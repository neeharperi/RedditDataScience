TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,161828,tifu,9044,"Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

P.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy. ",0.94,1.0,64.0,0.0,0.0,1941.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,137935,tifu,2601,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",0.95,1.0,45.0,-0.15,0.4,1667.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.,137658,tifu,3170,"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W

Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

Oh, and if you can read this, I’ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

"My 86-year-old grandmother replied ""OK, boomer"" to my boomer aunt in an argument",112673,teenagers,1991,"Backstory: I live round the corner from my gran and visit her often so thanks to me she has a vague grasp of what memes are and how they work. The other day when I was round at hers and she asked what memes were popular at the moment so I told her about the ""OK boomer"" meme. She knew what boomers were already so she was able to get the concept of this meme fairly easily. 

Fast forward to today, I'm over at my gran's again, and she's on the phone to my aunt. They got into a disagreement over a slightly racist comment my aunt made the other day (my gran is very much against racism) and my gran eventually just said ""OK boomer"" and hung up.

I've never been so proud.

UPDATE: So I told my gran about this post and the reaction it got - she said she's glad that so many of you enjoyed her little joke and that it proves she's still young at heart. I agree with that 100%.",0.91,1.0,80.0,0.5,0.5,876.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.",110076,IAmA,19622,"I’m excited to be back for my seventh AMA. I’ve learned a lot from the Reddit community over the past year (check out this fascinating [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/adxzo7/what_areas_of_robotics_research_are_you_most/) on robotics research), and I can’t wait to answer your questions.

If you’re wondering what I’ve been up to (besides waiting in line for hamburgers), I recently [wrote](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) about what I learned at work last year.

Melinda and I also just [published](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) our 11th Annual Letter. We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.

One of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.

**Proof:** [https://](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)[reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant\_wait\_to\_kick\_off\_my\_seventh\_ama/](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)

**Edit:** I have to sign-off soon, but I’d love to answer a few more questions about energy innovation and climate change. If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I’ll answer as many as I can later on.

Dying Before April: My Endgame,108476,marvelstudios,3949,"Liver cancer, mouth cancer, bone marrow failure. Will probably be dead before April. I've heard of people getting early screenings before. 

How do I get in on this action? 

I'm not a child or anyone with a particularly tragic story. Just a normal guy. I'm 33, lost my sister three years ago to the same rare genetic disease it turns out I have too. I'll leave behind a devoted girlfriend and an adopted greyhound.

I thought I'd make it to April at least but my bone marrow is toast.

Any suggestions?

***

**Edit:**

...

Wow.

Girlfriend brought me coffee in bed and I just read this entire thread. People offered me their organs. There's a hashtag on Twitter:

""Avengers4Alexander""

 This is crazy. 

God I hope I've never said anything dodgy in my comment history. 

Thank you all.

***

**Edit2:**

It's been a surreal day for me. There are articles on blogs and I heard someone talking about me in a YouTube video. 

I've had thousands of messages and comments of support and I'm very grateful. I've had lots of questions too and I've done my best to answer all of them. If I missed yours it's not personal, it's just that my inbox is out of control.

I've had background anxiety all day that I've said something offensive on reddit at some point and someone is gonna find it, but so far so good. That anxiety is of course drowned out by all the good feels.

I've had messages from people hinting that Marvel higher ups are aware of me and are preparing something. 

Also, because Australia is a small place, turns out I know a guy who knows a guy who is chums with Chris Hemsworth. I think they called him tonight on my behalf.

A mod on r/thanosdidnothingwrong asked for some proof so I sent something a little while ago. I think he'll disseminate it to other mods but if mods here want to see something let me know.

I don't know what the outcome will be but this has been amazing. If it doesn't pan out don't sweat it - I'll carry your kind words with me and that's worth far more.

If I do survive until Endgame it's gonna feel strange because I'll feel sorta obligated to die :-P

Lastly, I don't mean to be greedy but since I'm triple dying can we throw Captain Marvel into the mix?

**Edit3:**

I've had a few messages from people assuring me that Disney/Marvel are going to reach out. Thank you all for all of your support. I'm hoping I get to say ""we did it reddit!"" soon.

A few commenters have offered financial support. I've told them that money isn't my problem, just time. Instead I'd like to direct you to donate money for research into my genetic disease, Fanconi Anemia. You can do that [here](https://www.fanconi.org/donate).

***

**Edit4:**

#We did it Reddit!

Disney have reached out and we are discussing options. I cried when I read their email. It's everything I hoped for and I owe it to all of you.

***

**Edit5:**

I'm doing an AMA on Jan 24 at 7pm EST for those interested at r/IAmA

***

**Edit6:** 

I'm having SIRTEX treatment today. There's a 99.2% chance this will buy me more time, though Fanconi Anemia might affect this number dramatically.

If for some reason it doesn't work out, goodbye Reddit, and thank you.

""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain. Time to die.""

***

**Edit7:**

I'm still alive. I've just come out of what feels like a weeks-long dream. I'm on fentanyl and morphine 24/7 now, and it took a while to get the dose right, e.g, find the happy medium between screaming and being unconscious.

I can't cough, sneeze, laugh or burp now without through-the-roof agony, but I'm finding ways to manage these bodily functions to make them less painful. Typing this right now, I'm in no pain at all, and I've been up and out of bed and moving around, so my quality of life is still good.

A recent scan I had (after my pain escalated suddenly) revealed a host of bad things going on, few of which I know anything about yet. Following each of these up is the next step of my journey.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your support.

**Edit8:**

So I have lung cancer now.

***

**Edit9:**

They were wrong - it's liver metastases, not lung cancer. They can't be 100% sure because the lesions are in a position they can't biopsy, but they seem confident of their revised diagnosis.

My liver cancer has mutated an immunity to the first-line chemo. There is no second-line funded by Medicare. Fortunately, my doctors were able to apply to the manufacturer for compassionate access to the second-line drug and were successful. I started this new, more hardcore chemo three days ago. 

I'm gonna make it.

***

**Edit10:**

Tomorrow is the big day. 

I was admitted to hospital last night. While I was unconscious, a doctor asked my girlfriend whether they should resuscitate me if my heart stopped. When she said 'yes', they told her she was cruel and that I'd been through enough already. 

Fuck that guy.

My biggest challenge tomorrow will be making it out of here. I'm going to a 4.45pm session. Remember, if you spoil any part of Endgame, for anyone, I will haunt you, and not in a nice Casper way.

I hope you all enjoy Endgame. With luck I'll be there too.

**Edit11:**

NO SPOILERS

I fucking made it.

It took some ""negotiating"" around the hospital bureaucracy to escape. We told them we were going to see a movie. They granted me a two hour pass before I'd be considered discharged against medical advice. We were gone for about eight :-D.

We had the best seats in the house. I had a bag full of morphine and vomit bags which fortunately I didn't have to use. I was so enraptured with what was happening onscreen that it wasn't until it was over that I realised quite how sick and sore I was.

After the movie we had missed calls from the hospital, but fortunately my room was still empty when I got back. The nurses were a tad cranky. Worth it.

I won't share anything about how much I enjoyed Endgame here - you'll find me participating in the discussion throughout this subreddit. There's so much to talk about, I don't think I'll get bored of it in my lifetime.

Thanks to my crew who held our place in line, got us the best seats, carried me to my walker and matched my enthusiasm for the movie. Thanks to my bb who has been carrying me through life for a long time now, especially in the past week, and especially last night. I couldn't have made it without her, not nearly.

Thanks to Disney for [redacted].

And thanks to you guys - I was buoyed by your support. Every message reminded me that I could make it here. There was a part of the movie that really captured how I felt when you all came out to bat for me - I think you'll know it when you see it.

See you all around!

**Edit 12:**

Alexander's gf here. After seeing Endgame, he was in and out of hospital and told there were no further treatment options that would do less harm than good. 

He came home to be with his mum, me and Creeky. He saw the rest of GoT with all our friends around us. He blew the airhorn as soon as Cleganebowl began. In the finale he'd predicted several plot endings.

We were by his side until he left us Sunday morning.

"r/Atheism is a hate sub dedicated to hating religion, specifically Christianity",333,unpopularopinion,2653,"Somehow subs like r/atheism skate by the rules of hate on reddit by hating all religious people equally or some shit like that.

Today I saw this post [yeet](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/azvh5e/in_orlando_this_week_a_28_year_old_mother_stabbed/?st=JT6FN661&sh=04e7bc08) and I fail to understand how this sub hasn’t been banned.

Calling religion itself a mental disorder is bigoted and anti-cultural in every way. The sub wouldn’t have a tenth of its current popularity if not for the fact that it only talks about Christianity. Because who the fuck really talks about atheism itself? It’s just that you don’t believe in god, not a lot more to it other than the discrimination they get.

Basically, r/atheism does nothing but continuously shit on religious people and it really shouldn’t exist

Edit: brigading is getting intense boys lmao. This post used to have 900 upvotes

Edit 2: I suppose I was wrong on the banning of the sub issue. I realize now that that’d be unfair censorship. However I still believe (especially after this brigade) that r/atheism is a completely toxic community. The vast majority of the comments here just tell me to fuck myself or kill myself. I’ve gotten multiple death threats in messages (all of whom I’ve reported, fuck you guys). 

Overall, I don’t think atheists are toxic shitlords, but r/atheism sure as hell isn’t reassuring, and I shouldn’t be threatened and silenced for having an opinion

Edit for edit 2: yeah I realize that it sounds hypocritical, but that was the point of the edit. I’m apologizing for calling to the banning of r/atheism, and I’m trying to show that if you disagree with me then you shouldn’t send me death threats, because that’s the exact same incorrect thing I did

AITA for reporting a delivery driver who I thought was lying to get out of doing more work?,0,AmItheAsshole,877,"Throwaway account because I don’t want this linked to my main.

So today for lunch I decided to order from a Mexican restaurant through one of those food delivery services. I’ve had a bad experience or two where my order was missing some items, but the drivers would always be gone before I realized and could catch them to fix the issue. I’d always have to report it through the app’s support chat, which is such a pain to use because they obviously outsource their representatives and it’s frustrating trying to communicate with them. I usually give up after a few messages back and forth.

When my driver arrived, I told her to stay so that I could check the bag and make sure everything was there. I noticed she kind of raised her eyebrow for a moment but otherwise she stood quietly and waited. Sure enough, a couple things were missing. I politely said she needed to return to the restaurant and get my missing items.

In a very neutral, rehearsed-sounding tone, she said that it’s “against company policy to do that and I should contact support through the app.” I explained that I preferred not to deal with support. She said they’re the only ones who can help and she’s *really* not supposed to go back to the restaurant. 

I was a bit annoyed at this point so I asked what the company policy was on making sure orders were correct. She said that restaurants close the bags for the drivers and they’re not meant to open them or the containers inside. Something about food safety violations and not being trained (?). After a moment she apologized for the trouble and left. 

To me this honestly just sounds like a bunch of BS excuses to get out of doing her whole job. If they “can’t go back to the restaurant,” how are customers supposed to get their food/money back? If they “can’t open bags to check the orders” how do they even know they’re delivering the right food? It makes no sense to me.

So on the page where I rate my driver and can leave feedback, I made a note of my situation and explained why I thought she was in the wrong. I then left one star and revoked my tip.
A bit later I was talking to my sister over the phone, who I thought would enjoy the story because she works for a different-but-similar delivery company. My sister said “did you ACTUALLY think she was gonna go back to the restaurant?” I laughed, thinking she was taking a dig at a competing company’s drivers, but she just said “I’m not joking, you literally reported her for following the rules.”

At first I thought my sister had misunderstood a part of the story or something so I kind of brushed it off, but now based on her reaction and what both her and the driver said, I’m wondering if they’re right?

"I'm going to die any moment. Kind of stinks, but I'm not accept.",0,TrueOffMyChest,271,"I think two weeks ago? Honestly I don't remember when. I feel like it was two weeks ago maybe a little over. 

Anyways I started feeling different, I felt a little sleepy sure. But I had a different feeling inside me. It wasn't anywhere but in my head, I have this feeling that I'm ready to go home. 

It's like even in my own bed, I'm not at my house. I have a sensation that I'm ready to go to the next stage. 

Well several weeks ago I went to the doctor, and I was told I have liver failure. 

Unfortunately I haven't experienced many symptoms, or rather I failed to notice them. I asked my doctor what I could do, and he told me, "" If you had come months ago, you might have had a much better chance. As of right now, our options are limited.""

he went over some options including a liver transplant, wants me to stay in the hospital and get a room asap. 

I said no, I appreciate it but I have been ready for this. 

So I left. It wasn't an emergency room of was just a regular doctor at my urgent care. 

For a long time I felt like I was ready to leave this earth, and head home to where I should be. 

It was a very unexpected and sudden feeling.  

I have the most strangest urge to just lay down and go to sleep.

It's funny because we've all had the feeling of wanting to go to sleep, but this feels like it's going to be the last time. 

I've had some of my favorite ice cream just now, manage to cook myself my favorite meal earlier. I texted my girlfriend that I love her, and I shut off my phone immediately after it's sent. She's at work and won't see it for a little bit longer.

But I guess that my time has come. I wish I could really fully describe how I feel.

But the best way I can say it is, I'm ready to go home now. 

I've been on this site for a few years, but only recently have made an account. 

So I just want to say goodbye guys, I'm accepting of this it's okay. I understand that it is my time. 

At least I finally got to watch all the Marvel movies.

B.R.U.T.E. Balance Adjustments,0,FortNiteBR,2341,"Heya folks,

We have made several adjustments to the B.R.U.T.E., these changes are now live in all game modes and you do not need to download or patch your client.

We will also be temporarily disabling the Junk Rift, due to an audio issue, for this weekend's FNCS tournament and Arena playlists until the 10.20 update.

**B.R.U.T.E.**

* Decreased the maximum amount of rockets fired by the B.R.U.T.E. in a single charge from 10 to 6.
* Decreased the rate at which the rockets are fired from the B.R.U.T.E. by 56%.
   * *Our goal with these changes is to increase the back and forth between the users of the B.R.U.T.E. and the players they face. These changes allow the players on the receiving end of the missile volley to have more time to react and protect themselves.*
* Decreased the radius of the B.R.U.T.E.’s rocket explosion by 42%.
   * *Our goal here is to improve consistency and understanding around focused barrages of missiles. B.R.U.T.E.s will continue to be a strong option against structures, but less lethal against players.*
* Increased the dash cooldown from 3 seconds to 5 seconds.
   * *The previous dash cooldown not only increased the B.R.U.T.E.’s mobility, but also made the B.R.U.T.E.s a harder target to hit from distance than we’d like. This adjustment reduces the ability to close gaps quickly while in the B.R.U.T.E. while also increasing the ability to land shots on target for players facing the B.R.U.T.E.*
* Decreased the velocity gained from boosting while in air by 33%.
   * *We want to reduce a B.R.U.T.E.’s ability to engage and disengage at long distances to encourage a more strategic approach to an encounter. In general we hope to shift B.R.U.T.E.s away from being highly mobile and put more emphasis on their already defensive nature.*
* The B.R.U.T.E. no longer grants materials to the driver and passenger when stomping or dashing through the environment.
   * Note: This change should roll out shortly following the other changes.
   * *Our goal is to add more tension between being in and out of a B.R.U.T.E. as well as reduce instances where players can farm faster than intended without exposing themselves to danger.*
* Adjusted the variability of spawn rates for storm phases 1, 2, and 3 in core modes. Arena spawn rates will remain unchanged.
   * Storm phase 1
      * **New spawn rates**
      * 29% chance to spawn 0.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 1.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 2.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 3.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 4.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 5.
      * **Old spawn rates**
      * 33% chance to spawn 2.
      * 33% chance to spawn 3.
      * 33% chance to spawn 4.
   * Storm phase 2
      * **New spawn rates**
      * 25% chance to spawn 0.
      * 25% chance to spawn 1.
      * 25% chance to spawn 2.
      * 25% chance to spawn 3.
      * **Old spawn rates**
      * 33% chance to spawn 2.
      * 33% chance to spawn 3.
      * 33% chance to spawn 4.
   * Storm phase 3
      * **New spawn rates**
      * 25% chance to spawn 0.
      * 25% chance to spawn 1.
      * 25% chance to spawn 2.
      * 25% chance to spawn 3.
      * **Old spawn rates**
      * 33% chance to spawn 1.
      * 33% chance to spawn 2.
      * 33% chance to spawn 3.
   * *Previously, the early stages of a match were guaranteed a minimum amount of B.R.U.T.E.s. We’d like to provide a little more variance to that experience so that matches don’t always play out the same way. The overall average number of B.R.U.T.E.s per game is reduced slightly.*
* Decreased the material cost of using the gunner’s overshield from 200 to 75.
   * *Our goal is to further emphasize use of materials for positive defensive benefit.*
* Increased the Health of the B.R.U.T.E from 1000 to 1250.
   * *With the above changes, users of the B.R.U.T.E. need to play a bit more strategic than before, so we want to give a little bit longer of a window to do so.*

"Why it's IMPOSSIBLE to have a National Dex from now on, explained by a Game Artist",0,PokemonSwordAndShield,509,"Hello, I've seen a lot o protest in the community, a lot of people being unreasonable about Sword & Shield don't having all Pokémon (or the games never having a National Dex again, at least for in this console generation, we'll come to that).

&#x200B;

So, as a **Game Artist**, I wanted to explain why it's **impossible for Game Freak to make a game with 800+ Pokémon in the HD era.**

&#x200B;

I'll be explaining that **analysing ACTUAL models ripped from games**, using **professional software** like MAYA, and Photoshop.

So let's start.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**MODEL ANALYSIS**

&#x200B;

So as I said, these models are ripped from XY.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Mewtwo Folder](https://preview.redd.it/f8wk3nz173431.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=312c0fa0e6d1a3ca09e9f84ff6b992eaa59032f0)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As you can see, the folder size is 16,9 MB. This includes all models, textures, Mega-Evolution models, animations, shiny textures, everything.

&#x200B;

So let's look at the model first...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Mewtwo Model XY](https://preview.redd.it/k5wznfly73431.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ebfe672b1bef8c3d999cc60be57d9c1d9f924e)

So over 6000 faces, not really High-Poly, but pretty decent for a 3DS game, which explains the performance issues the games had on 3DS when multiple Pokémon where on screen.

&#x200B;

Than let's look at the textures...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Mewtwo Color](https://preview.redd.it/lk5p37tc93431.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b258102cabef05f99bc223014d22ca466d19b0)

So here is the Mewtwo Color Map, which defines the color of the texture. As you can see, it's pretty low resolution only being only 512x256, this wouldn't hold up at all in a Switch game, as a texture has to be 1024x1024 or higher at least to be considere ""high definition"".

&#x200B;

Looking at other files, you can see that the size of the folders are obviously different from Pokémon to Pokémon, since some are smaller, don't have mega evoluitons and stuff...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/klm9ffs3j3431.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9958998259edb755e07788df99af7033901eed2

&#x200B;

So let's just say an average Pokémon **needs around 5 MB of space for XY** (since Mewtwo was only that big because of the 2 megas, 16/3= 5,3333' for one form only), this is **LOW RESOLUTION game, keep this in mind, it will be important, 5 MB average.**

&#x200B;

**SWITCH MODEL COMPARISON**

&#x200B;

So now, let's compare it to a Switch model. I didn't found Mewtwo, but it doesn't matter actually.

&#x200B;

First the model:

&#x200B;

[Pikachu from LPGE I deleted the extra stuff the partner Pokémon](https://preview.redd.it/esbgvoypb3431.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=4926eb6e4ca9ad47826925ce77478f5aae235282)

As you can see, Pikachu already has more faces than the 3DS Mewtwo, 7000+, which is impressing considering Pikachu is a much smaller Pokémon, being maybe, a third of the size from Mewtwo?.

&#x200B;

*EDIT: Ia wanted to clarify this, the only LGPE models I found was the partner Pokémon, that's why I used it. However, l deleted the extra stuff the partner Pokémon has as you can see (no haircuts and stuff). It would'nt matter anyway because that would be a difference of some KB only.*

&#x200B;

So let's look at the folder size and textures, **here it gets REALLY interesting...**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j5hlfk8em4431.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=d28d15b7e4cb5f960e94048e0e24d16a254cd913

So as you can see, the Pikachu folder size from Switch is almost the same as Mewtwo, 16 MB. But remember, Mewtwo was 3 (!) Pokémon actually, because of the Megas.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Pikachu Color Map](https://preview.redd.it/lhky4re7d3431.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&s=63caf90ca2e27d6c3b0c036514784708c5751465)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So it's sure to assume, that a Pokémon in **an HD game is 3 TIMES the size of an low resoluiton one!**

Which is pretty logical, since you need higher poly counts on the models, higher resolution textures, more animations etc.

*EDIT: People are complaining  why I did'nt compare the same Pokémon in the games, how ever I didn't find the same models in the two games, and it doesn't matter anyway because it's an approximation, we're using the two models just as references to get an idea. At the end, the numbers would be same.*

&#x200B;

*EDIT 2: So I found the model for the XY Pikachu. And as I said it woud'nt matter, it didn't.*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b42q02iug4431.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b00593d40bfd1ca4c02503cc6179f73ac48d48

&#x200B;

[XY Pikachu. As you can see, it's exactly the same model with less poly \(4000+ xy \< 7000+ lpge\)](https://preview.redd.it/13hv9qyai4431.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae151095d6705266d414283cbb08a1f33f5522f4)

*The file size here is 6 MB, so it's near to the 5 MB AVERAGE we established before. So in average, I still come to the conclusion Pokémon on Switch are about 3 times bigger, it's a reasonable, realistic number. Anyway, don't forget to consider that for Sword & Shield, the files will be problably even slightly bigger in average, we don't know that, but it's also logical.*

*At the end I think it's clear that the general problem is that the files are too big.*

&#x200B;

*Please understand that I will not further explain this, don't think about the two models, they're just examples, and again, the result is the same. Thank you :)*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So let's summarize what we learned:**

&#x200B;

**A Pokémon in an HD game takes about 3 times more space than in a SD game like XY, since an average Pokémon in XY took only 5 MB, and a pretty small Pokémon like Pikachu already took over 15 MB.**

&#x200B;

Now let's calculate how big the files would be for a Pokédex with let's say **900 Pokémon**, which would be problaby what we would get in Sword and Shield if it had a ND.

&#x200B;

**15 MB x 900 PKMN =  13500  MB  = 13,5 GB (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)**

&#x200B;

*EDIT: Yes, I didn't consider compression, but even than it could be too big since this is only for Pokémon, and that's only one part of the problem anyway.*

&#x200B;

**GUYS**, it's **13 GIGS** only for the Pokémon!!! **ONLY FOR THE POKÉMON!**

&#x200B;

For example, **Zelda Breath of the Wild is 14 GB (compressed):**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h051mrs1f3431.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd744d6cb93991b7909430baf527e46250044cce

And again that's  only for the Pokémon, where are not counting the levels, music, codes and all the other stuff.

&#x200B;

The most common cartridge **capacity for AAA games** on Switch is **ONLY 16 GB,** in theory, there are 32 GB cards, but since the production costs for cartridges is so expensive compared to CDs, most developers prefer to keep their file size under 16 GB, even for big games like Zelda.( source:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo\_game\_card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_game_card) )

Which explains why games like FIFA have less content on the Switch, **it's because of the cartridge production costs (and other reasons, but the cartridge IS  the biggest problem...).**

&#x200B;

So that's a big deal, since they can make way more money if their games are under 16 GB. Off course, there's the possibility of downloading the rest of the game, but you have to consider that Nintendo doesn't do that like third parties, like they did with Lego was it I think, because it's bad for the consumer and it also takes a lot of place in their servers, which off course means more money spent. And even then, **15 GB only for Pokémon**, so let's say we would need **10 more GB for the rest**, that means people would have to **download 10 GB before they could play**. Nintendo doesn't do that, that would upset people, **which is why 99% of all NSW games are UNDER 16 GB.**

&#x200B;

**And besides, it takes YEARS** to develop all that Pokémon, even if the models are done since XY, as you saw, they have to be **more high poly for the Switch**, the textures must be redone, they need more animations...

&#x200B;

So, these are the reasons why we are **problably NOT seing National Dex in the next Pokémon games**, since Game Freak would lose millions of dollars if they did.

&#x200B;

**MY OPPINION about this:**

&#x200B;

As a Pokémon fan, does that makes me **sad**? **YES**. Off course I would like to have all Pokémon.

&#x200B;

But am I **UPSET**? Am I saying Sword and Shield is shit and should be cancelled?? **NO!**

&#x200B;

Because I understad that it's **not possible, NO GAME COMPANY** in the world would do this! They would lose millions!

With the Pokémon fans wanting a new Pokémon game every two years at least, they would have the **whole 2 years of crunch time**, with their **artists working to death**, their **families being worried** about them, with them getting psychological problems because of the stress...

&#x200B;

**Gamefreak is actually doeing pretty cool things in this game**, the Galar region is awesome, the Wild area is awesome, to ignore that, just because you want all Pokémon, is just **very unfair**, and shows that you don't understand how games work, I'm not blaiming you for that, thas why I wrote this article to explain it :)

&#x200B;

**Game Freak chose QUALITY over QUANTITY, and HEALTHINESS over BURNOUT and we should be thankful for that.**

Update on Anthem from the Development Team,0,AnthemTheGame,3850,"Here is an update from Ben (Lead Producer) & Chad (Head of Live Services) on the Act 1 90 day calendar. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

Hey Everyone,

&#x200B;

It’s been 10 weeks since the early access release of Anthem. While we have been quiet publicly, we have been hard at work in the background and we wanted to provide an update on the state of the game.

&#x200B;

**The Past 10 Weeks**

We have learned a lot since the game went live. We have heard a lot of feedback from all of you, and we have been working diligently to improve as many things as we can in the short term.

We’ve fixed a lot of bugs and made changes which we believe begin to point us in the right direction for the future. That being said, we know there is a long way to go before Anthem becomes the game we all want it to be. So where are we at today…

&#x200B;

**Game Update 1.1.0**

Game Update 1.1.0 went live today and includes some new content and improvements to the game:

* A new Stronghold called “The Sunken Cell”
* Access to the Forge anywhere in the world
* Ability to launch a new expedition from the end of expedition menu without loading into Fort Tarsis
* Access to contracts without having to run around and pick them up

There are a bunch of additional fixes and improvements – the patch notes for Game Update 1.1.0 can be found[ here](https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/patch-110).

There is also a livestream later today where we will show you the Sunken Cell Stronghold and some of the other improvements in Game Update 1.1.0

&#x200B;

**Act 1 Calendar**

While we have delivered many of the Act 1 features on time, we are not going to hit all the goals on our[ Act 1 Calendar](https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/acts).

We have been prioritizing things like bug fixes, stability and game flow over the new features of Act 1. We set aside time for this work, but the reality is there are more things to fix and improve than we planned for.  While this is the best thing to do for the game, it means some items from the calendar will be delayed.

&#x200B;

**Features delayed:**

* Mastery System
* Guilds
* Legendary Missions – Phase II
* Weekly Stronghold Challenge
* Leaderboards
* Some Freeplay Events
* Cataclysm

&#x200B;

We want to make sure everything we add to the game has a purpose and fits with our long term goals. When we have information to share on the items above, we will do so.

&#x200B;

**Cataclysm**

The Cataclysm is an important addition to the game and it’s currently a big focus for the team. The Cataclysm will bring new challenges and rewards and pushes the story of Anthem forward. As our work continues, we will share more with you in May.

&#x200B;

**Loot**

We have heard your concerns around end game loot. We agree that our loot and progression systems need to be improved and we are working towards this. When we have more information to share, we will.

&#x200B;

**Communication**

A lesson we have learned is we have been talking about things too early. There are so many factors that can cause us to pivot on our plans – whether it’s bugs & stability issues, player feedback, or complications with a feature that require us to take more time to deliver it. Our goal is to tell you about new content and features once the work is closer to being done. 

At the same time, we want to provide more ways to get your feedback and for you to tell us what you think is fun (or not fun). To facilitate this we plan to introduce a Player Feedback Environment (PFE), an opportunity to get your feedback before we go live with major features (in the short term for PC only).

&#x200B;

**Closing** 

We know you have been waiting for these updates, and that you might not be pleased with where we are today. We understand and respect these perspectives.

The only thing we can say is this – We Believe in Anthem. We believe the game will be great, but we recognize getting there will take a lot of hard work. We want to do that work and we want you all to join us on the journey to get there.

Thanks for taking the time to read this update.

For all the new folks coming here,68,Sino,365,"Reposting since it looks like our sub is getting a lot of attention again.  Updated with recent context.

\--------------------------------------

First, welcome to [/r/sino](https://www.reddit.com/r/sino/). Even if you're here from a brigading subreddit, welcome to the sub, and please participate in good faith. We don't want to shut you guys out - we want to hear your perspective as well, as long as you follow the rules of the subreddit and engage in meaningful discussion.

With that out of the way, you may be coming here with a set of preconceived notions around China or this subreddit due to the recent Hong Kong protests and follow-on social media manipulation efforts. If so, let me be clear: **I am happy to engage, and most of the posters here would be too**. No beliefs you come with will make me think less of you - on [/r/sino](https://www.reddit.com/r/sino/), the only criterion we judge each other by is our ability or inability to gather the truth from facts.

Indeed, if you come in here hating China because China banned the NBA or Blizzard ""appeased"" China, I want to engage with you.  Hell, I don't agree that banning an entire sports league for a Twitter statement by a single executive is the right way for the world to hear China's grievances on Hong Kong - and that this post is staying on this sub should show you that we embrace free speech.

If you came in here hating the Chinese Communist Party because you read a skewed article from taiwannews or the Hong Kong Free Press, I want to engage with you, because you are a victim of propaganda. If you want to downvote everything positive about China or the Chinese government because you saw your friends or fellow citizens get tear gassed and shot with beanbag rounds, I want to engage even more, because you are a victim of political tension in Hong Kong caused by both the US and Chinese governments. These last few weeks have made us all angry, no doubt, but together, we can heal and find a better way forwards.

You may ask why I care. To me, this is personal.

My family originated out of four individuals that fought for China. Not all on the same side, mind you. The first repurposed the family factories to making bullets to fight the Japanese. The second returned home from studying engineering in the US to design machine tools and assembly lines for the war effort. A third played cat and mouse with Japanese and KMT death squads in Shanghai, setting up dozens of cells for the Communist Party and dodging three arrest attempts before she was finally smuggled to safety. The fourth, he fought **for** Chiang, carrying and bleeding upon the Blue Sky White Sun flag in desperate rearguard actions to win time for refugees fleeing the genocidal Imperial Japanese Army. And, tragically, when the Japanese surrendered, they fought each other. But in the end, they - and their siblings - all fought for their shared dream of a new China - as staff officers and scientists; financiers, industrialists, and politicians in both parties.

Afterwards, they ended up scattered between Singapore, the United States, Taiwan, and the mainland. Some of them were purged and imprisoned by the KMT or CCP. When they first met in the 80s, many of them hadn't seen each other for decades. That day, they didn't agree on much, except for three things: stay away from politics if you can, but if push comes to shove, China is always worth fighting for - and foreigners will always try to split China by taking advantage of those who care about China.

For most of my life, I have followed their first rule. I've stayed quiet. But in the last few years, predatory forces have gathered on the doorstep of China to rob the Chinese people of everything they have built over the last four decades - and the divisions and scars that mark the Chinese soul are the easiest way for them to do it. I now realize - on behalf of my grandparents who bled for this land - it is imperative to heal those scars. Because they were right on the second and third as well.

Because the China you live in - no matter whether you call it Beijing or Hong Kong or Shanghai or Taipei - is your home. **It belongs to you, and you own it.**

Because the China you see was built with the blood, sweat, and tears of the Chinese people - your mother, your father, your brothers, your sisters, and **you**. Your hard work made this possible. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.

Because how tragic it would be, if the foreign bastards made you spill blood against your own flesh and blood so that they could come in and loot it all.

**Because how pitiful you would be**, if you just sat back and let it happen, or even encouraged it with your own misbegotten anger.

Because the China of today stands for more than what Radio Free Asia paints it as - it stands for providing a **good life for its citizens, no matter what**, and **attempting to give the World an example to follow, rather than an overseer's whip ordering the World around.**

Because China is worth fighting for, and we must protect China, together - support her when she is right, chastise her when she is wrong, and cherish her, always. And no matter how you think that ought to be accomplished - as long as you have the Chinese people in your heart, you are always welcome in mine, and welcome to this sub.

&#x200B;

**WEAPON BALANCE**

**Disruptor Rounds with Alternator:**

* Reduced Shielded damage multiplier 1.7 -> 1.55.
   * *Designer Notes: Disruptor rounds on the alternator are shredding shields a bit too quickly and still proving to be stronger than intended, so we're reducing the disruptor rounds multiplier on shield damage*.

**RE-45:**

* Increased Magazine Size for all tiers to the following:
   * Base: 16
   * Common: 19
   * Rare: 22
   * Epic: 25
   * *Designer Notes: We’re giving the RE-45 a small boost in power by giving it one more round for every mag size. Downing a non-fortified enemy with the RE-45 with 0, 50, 75, and 100 shields requires 10, 14, 16, and 19 shots respectively, so this extra round gives the gun the ability to one-mag more armored enemies instead of leaving them barely alive.*

**R-301:**

* Increased vertical and horizontal recoil. Slightly increased recoil pattern randomness.
   * *Designer Notes: We’ve made these changes as we’ve seen that the R301 is a bit stronger than intended at long range. We’ve adjusted recoil to balance keeping it effective at medium to close range--which is the original intent--but it should be more difficult for players to auto fire and still laser enemies at long distances.*

**LEGENDS**

**General**

* Made adjustments to Pathfinder’s and Low-Profile Legends hitboxes.
   * Taking shots to the hip now does torso damage instead of leg damage. This should more closely match the behavior of the other Legends.
* Fixed a bug where activating a healing item would cancel the Ultimate for Legends that need to prime it \[Bangalore / Pathfinder / Caustic / Gibraltar / Bloodhound\]
* Fixed an exploit where players would sometimes be able to still shoot while downed.

**Bloodhound**

* Increased the distance that Bloodhound can see traversal clues left by other players \[but not other kinds of clues\] to 25 meters.
* Adjusted the area of effect for Bloodhound’s Tactical to 125 fov.

**Wraith**

* Based on player feedback, we’ve reduced the “hum” audio that’s playing while using Wraith’s Kunai.
* Fixed issue where actions for Wrath would have a slight delay when her weapon is holstered and crouching or sliding while the kunai is equipped.
* Fixed an exploit that allowed players to remove the cooldown for Wraith’s Tactical Ability.

**Mirage**

* Fixed bug where Mirage was able to stay invisible and still be able to shoot and melee when using his Ultimate on a zipline.

**Octane**

* Fixed bug where sometimes Octane’s Jump Pad would not launch the player.",0.55,0.0,52.0,0.17045454545454544,0.5,6651.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Can my parents/school force me to take heart medication?,201,legaladvice,24,"I'm 15 and a boy, I live in New York (state).

Several months ago I had a heart burn that was misinterpreted by doctors to be a ""heart attack"" (it wasn't, simply put, severe over exaggeration.) Since then I've been made to take ""medication"" at home, which I don't want to bc I've read about the side affects and I don't want to be taking something for an issue that doesn't exist.

Since I got it originally I just stopped taking the pills, which long story short my parents found out about and it has been a very big fight with them since. They have contacted my (public) school and after they had a talk with me and the principal basically what has been happening is I come in in the morning and they force me to go in a room with the guidance conseuler and an extra person and watch me swallow the pills that I ""need"". For some time I'd go and make myself vomit immediately after in the bathroom and they found out and now I have to stay for twenty minutes and drink water. They do not let me go to classes if I refuse.

How can this be legal? I'm sorry to ask here but I literally cannot find information on this anywhere. Where would I even report this if the principal is in on it?",0.52,0.0,56.0,0.0,0.0,1187.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"I’m Stefan Thomas and I introduced millions of people to Bitcoin, was in charge of the technology for the third largest cryptocurrency, and hate blockchain. AMA!",0,IAmA,937,"Hello!

My name is Stefan Thomas. I started programming when I was four years old and have been addicted to it ever since.

Starting in 2010, I got involved with Bitcoin, produced the [“What is Bitcoin?” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo) that introduced millions of people to Bitcoin, and created [BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs), the first implementation of Bitcoin cryptography in the browser.

My dream was to make crypto-currency mainstream, so in 2012 I joined a startup called [Ripple](https://ripple.com/). I told them that I wanted to be a coder only, and not a manager. Eight months later, they made me CTO. While I was there, we built a blockchain that is 200x faster, 1000x cheaper, and vastly more energy-efficient than Bitcoin. The underlying cryptocurrency, XRP, is now the third-largest in the world.

I think cryptocurrency is a powerful idea, politically and economically. But managing a blockchain system at scale sucks. A shared ledger, by definition, is a tightly coupled system, something we engineers spend much of our time trying to avoid, with good reason. So what comes after blockchain?

[Interledger](https://interledger.org/) is a (non-blockchain) payment protocol I helped create in 2015. Interledger is able to process transactions faster, and at a much larger scale than blockchain systems. It’s closer to something like TCP/IP - it has no global state and passes around little packets of money similar to how IP passes around packets of data.

Last year, I founded a company called [Coil](https://coil.com/). We’re using Interledger to create a better business model for creators on the Web. Instead of putting a company in the middle like Spotify or Netflix, we’re putting an [open standard](https://webmonetization.org/) in the middle and companies like ours compete to provide access. Some members of our community created a subreddit at [r/CoilCommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoilCommunity/).

"This game is literally a joke, change my mind.",187,modernwarfare,759,"16 years this franchise has been pumping out disc scan after disc scan and here's a list of stupid shit that has plagued the game since I started playing in MW2. And how to fix them

Format: 

- Problem

 - Solution
- Spawning right in front of or around the corner from enemy players and dying either instantly or as soon as you move.
 
 - Literally one line of code: if enemy.player < 10m away CHOOSE ANOTHER SPAWN POINT | Alternatively give us the option to spawn on teammates or choose our spawn point like in groundwar, therefore we don't spawn on anyone actively in combat or near any action, if we don't want to. 

- Player movement latency(shooting someone and in the killcam they strafed away from the bullet)

 - Stop being cheap bastards and run better servers

- Shotguns not killing someone with a chest shot at sufficient range

 - How about, if more than 40 percent of the spread hit a pellet in the enemys chest, he's dead because no one is moving with a fucking collapsed lung.

- Footsteps, why the fuck can I hear my own footsteps like a marching band in my ear both when I'm alive and in the enemy killcams. Yet people on the other team walking around the fucking corner for me sound like they have Ninja Pro?! get it? CAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE SOUNDS! or maybe they do! And I just can't hear them because my guy sounds like he's slapping his boots on the floor and every time we cap or lose a point in domination I get earraped even though there's permanent in game markers that tell me what team owns what point.

 - Give the option to disable ""minuscule"" sound cues, make a noise profile where footsteps are the loudest sound aside from gets right above you. Or, and this is a CRAZY idea: make the raw footstep file louder? WHOA

- Recoil RNG. It's 2019 and the guns still randomly jump around like a jack rabbit on crack making recoil control finesse nigh impossible unless you're playing on controller in which there's literally an auto-aim profile that leads the reticle in front of running players FOR YOU

 - Take 1 day on your schedule and draw a recoil pattern for each gun, code it into the game. Holy shit look at that, now people actually ~~have to~~ **can** try to aim instead of just spraying and praying. 

- The map design literally favors people picking spots to sit at and watch certain areas of the map. ESPECIALLY in game modes that have objectives. Once a team has any objective, pushing it becomes difficult as there is only one to two places to enter from a given direction, and yet 7 places in a 360 radius that could have an angle on that spot. Making it extremely risky to run out in the open and actually play the game in its ""fast paced"" advertised fashion.

 - Stop designing the maps like an office full of weekend airsoft players.

- Nameplate placement is super bugged right now. Usually people will be prone on the side of kind of box shaped cover. When you aim above the box (expecting someone to be head peeking there) you see the enemies name plate above the cover instead of in front of the cover and over their head. Have died countless times because I saw a name and started shooting even though they weren't even in my reticle.

 - How did this even get fucked up when you literally copy and paste the basics for every game when you start the next one? What did you think you could start from scratch after all this time of being the least innovative game devs of the decade and do it right?

Two bugs with new features just for shits and giggles

- Sniper glares can be seen through walls if any pixel of the players body is peeking past a corner or edge. How did EA get this one right and you guys can't?

 - Tell the game to process it's logic correctly

- Volumetric lighting & ray tracing. these fancy lighting features have been plauging FPS games since R6. Nobody wants to not be able to see into a doorway until their literally IN IT solely because you want the games sky to look pretty. Countless times I've died because people are headglitching with the sun behind them and all I see is the stupid light rays that these fucks think ""looks cool"" when I'm trying to shoot people as intended. 

 - Remove it. Nobody fucking cares how realistic the lighting is if they can't fucking see the people their supposed to shoot. It's not a fair fight if I can't fucking see the guy shooting at me because he's in a doorway and I'm outside. 

This game is a joke. Catered for 12 year olds with controllers to hold a button and let the game aim for them, all the while they hold angles and stare at the same spots from the same 3 places all. fucking. game.

University expulsion due to cheating,144,legaladvice,37,"TL;DR: Cheated on two exams during my last semester of university by obtaining a professor's login information and seeing the exams before they were given. Professor gave me an F in the course but passed the information along to higher-ups, who subsequently expelled me. I will be appealing my case, I have a few more days to send in an appeal letter. After I send in my appeal I am entitled (based on the code of conduct) to a hearing in front of the dean. I have contacted an attorney who is looking at everything. I want to know what the best course of action is to make my chances as strong as possible in getting my sanctions lessened. Location is United States.

&#x200B;

The course I cheated in was NOT a major course. I completed all of my major courses by merit, and this is my first cheating offense. I have never been accused of misconduct or wrongdoing in my 4 years at this university.

First and foremost - I have reached out to an attorney who has recommended me a few things, but I wanted to come here as well for any and all advice. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

Backstory:

Sometime in February, I planted a camera behind the keyboard in the classroom where my professor lectured. Once she typed in her login information, I was able to view the video and obtain her login information to use for my own personal benefit. On dozens of occasions, I logged on using the professor’s login information on school computers in labs that have cameras, and viewed exams, past labs, and even changed my own grade in the course. The first exam, around late march, I had seen the answer key prior to taking the exam, and naturally got a 100% on the exam. No suspicion was raised by the professor. I continued to view answer keys prior to the next exam, which was taken in late april. My exams were very identical to the answer keys. I had noticed that the professor changed her password after the second exam when I went to login again, and so I put the camera back in the same place as the first time. However this time, at some point during the video it shows her looking directly at the camera, implying that she did indeed see it.  In the beginning of May about a week after the second exam, my professor came up to me after class and asked for me to come with her to the department chair’s office. When I sat down, the department chair told me that there was a strong suspicion of me cheating on exams 1 and 2, and asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them. I said “I admit, I cheated on them.” That is all I said. I did not admit to how I cheated. Afterwards, he asked me how I cheated, to which I did not respond. They had me sign a form essentially stating that I admitted to cheating and that they were going to pass along the information to the academic affairs committee for further investigation and potentially further sanctions on top of an F in the course. About a week later, a police officer from the university came to my apartment and asked me to come with him. He drove me to the campus police station, where I was questioned about “illegal computer usage.” An hour later, at the academic affairs office, I was informed verbally that I was going to be expelled from the university, and a day later, I received a letter reiterating the fact that I had been expelled. The letter says that I will not get a degree, can not participate in graduation, and can not be readmitted to the university, now or in the future.

&#x200B;

I reached out to an attorney yesterday, and will be meeting with him tomorrow.

&#x200B;

The steps I am taking for this:

&#x200B;

The university allows students to appeal the decision within 5 days of receiving the letter, which I am doing. Essentially the appeal that I have written states that I admit my actions were egregious, and that I felt so much pressure to pass the course and felt awful when I cheated even before I got caught. I said that I wanted to fess up but didn't know how, and that when I was confronted I did not at all try to justify my actions, hide them, or lie. I came clean completely, and the burden was finally off. In my appeal I am respectfully asking for my sanctions to be lessened to at most a suspension from the university so that I can still graduate, albeit not on time.

&#x200B;

I have not yet sent the letter, as I still have a few more days to submit the appeal, and I am waiting for my attorney to look at the letter tomorrow and give me any advice. The reason I got an attorney was so that I could either:

a) heavily grovel (an attorney cannot be present during the hearing) and the attorney would just help me before I go in

b) basically sue the school saying the sanctions are too harsh

&#x200B;

I will NOT be denying my actions. The school has sufficient proof that I used the professor's login credentials for my own benefit. I have to come clean, and just hope that the school shows mercy. If the appeal does not go well, I will resort to plan B, which is getting the attorney directly involved.

&#x200B;

"Regarding Article 13, Europe's ""anti-meme"" law...",2697,dankmemes,0,"Hi, we have been getting tons of modmails asking us about Europe's new Article 13 law that just passed. The fear is that it bans memes that feature copyrighted content, so basically all memes. With the exception of loomynartylenny, who is actually studying international law, we are kind of ignorant what this means in the real world, aka the USA and more specifically, /r/dankmemes. One of the chief points of Article 13 is that the person posting the content is not the only one liable for damages, but also the website that allows it, and could that also mean mods? Some of us have lofty ambitions in life and we do not need a criminal record just so your [Drake meme about marmite and crumpets can be seen.](https://i.imgur.com/5WWCxQu.png)

[This article about Article 13](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47708144) gave us a sigh of relief but then Loomy told us that we shouldn't take it at face value, that they promise things like this all the time to try to entrap people. He reminded us of that [time the UK banned all hardcore bondage porn](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/porn-block-uk-wired-explains) and how it led to one of his friends being interviewed by police, his friend honestly believed he was within the law but still got a knock on the door. That isn't really something we signed up for when we became mods. Making out with each other while removing your posts, that's why we're here, not this.

We tried to contact some legit legal type people who don't mind being paid in bits of string, but the best we could come up with were other redditors. Long story short, between speaking to them and speaking to admins, nobody seems willing to give us a straight answer on our personal liability if a lawsuit is filed against a user of dankmemes. ""Guess we'll just have to find out ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ ""   isn't good enough when you're talking about potential legal costs and damage to reputation, potential lost wages, in the case of one dankmemes mod who is someone mildly important IRL, it could damage their future political career. These things are important, not your jolly good brexit meme. 

Starting immediately until we have definitive proof that this won't make us liable, we are going to have to do our due diligence to get potential Article 13 memes out of here. This sub is incredibly busy, it's not an easy task at all, and I really wish you Europeans could follow your own damn laws and not put us in this position in the first place, but asap, all posts from europe will not be allowed. We tried our best to come up with ways to do this so nothing else is really affected but the only way to be certain that we don't have a problem is to prevent people who show signs of being European from posting at all. 

Enter /u/article_13_bot, I am really **really** sorry to do this to le redditeurs and das shitposters but I don't understand why we can't get a straight answer on this topic from anyone. Hopefully, this will expedite the delivery of promises made to us to find out more info and ""keep us posted"". ***ALL EU BASED r/dankmemes USERS WILL BE BANNED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE***.

Also, since there is no way this thread will go well, I'm just going to go ahead and lock it and immediately go to bed. I am really sorry that we are in this position, I'm hoping it will be temporary. If not, may I recommend the vibrant and robust communities in /r/britishmemes and /r/frenchmemes. Last month we had almost ten posts! 





Je suis désolé, Es tut mir leid, Mi dispiace, Sinto muito, Förlåt, Lo siento 

Sincerely,

Susan

Car parked in garage and social usage only.

My insurance quote comes out as £8,438. How is this fair? Just because I'm a teenager? Honestly it's cheaper for me to drive without insurance, get disqualified, retake my test, and get a fine, get a non custodial sentence than to pay 8 grand annually.

Do I have a free car?,27,legaladvice,48,"FROM: California, USA. 

So the small amount of background to this story is that, I recently (3 months ago) leased a new car. After three months of no bills, I checked in, and figured out the following had happened to the contract. 

When filing the contract with the auto dealer, Nissan kicked back the contract because of a very small error ($1.75 tax in Cali per tire, but they taxed a 5th, backup tire that my car doesn’t come with). They sent it back to the dealership to be fixed, but in that time, the dealership was sold to someone else. 

The lease was pretty much in limbo, with really being in no place at the time that it had been sold. Nissan didn’t have it, and the new company didn’t have it. 

Now, the new dealership is sending us a contract to be signed. Do we have any legal obligation to sign, or could we just go down to the DMV and remove them from the lease, since there’s no contractual evidence that gives them any ownership over the car?

In some mildish defense of the dex cut. From the views of a 3d modeler.,89,NintendoSwitch,445,"So. As we all know. Pokemon sword and shield is coming and right now the big hot topic is the cut dex. Truthfully, last time i saw these kinds of flames was when fallout 76 opened its doors.  However. Bethesda is a whole other topic (port fallout 3 or 4 already, damnit) 

But back on the topic of S&S. I do smell some bad management that led to the cut dex. But i also feel that this may of been a long time coming. Sneezing the question into google of “how many pokemon are there” brings up 829 pokemon. 

If we were still in the days of sprites. This Wouldn’t be too bad. As drawing them out on paper, color and porting to the game wouldnt be to bad. Thats why so many indie games are 2d. Its extremely easy to work with. 

In the realm of 3d however. Things arent so kind. All the sudden you have to worry about how it actually would be. What its side are like. Its shape, etc, etc. this usually goes through a process like this, per model 

-concept art
-color
-modeling
-rigging
-weight painting
-uv unwrapping
-texturing
-engine implementation
-bug fixing  

 That doesnt sound too bad, right? Well. Think again. Now. I’m gonna stop here because i can already hear the keyboard warriors typing “they’re just porting the 3DS models!!!!!” 
I hear people saying this all the time. But does no one seem to realize the asiening process of porting things? 

Not a lot of people realize what exactly goes on under the hood of porting. You have to use multitude of softwares, engines, and tools. And even then. Sometimes shit just doesn’t work. 

Most companies and studios design their models in a external engine thats made for modeling, like blender or 3ds max, then ported to what ever engine they’re using for the game. Which sounds simple enough but it can be flat out development hell.  

Let me explain why. Though engines have gotten friendlier over the years. They can still be a royal pain in the ass to work with. As not everything is plug and play. So, having everything come over smoothly. Is not guaranteed, Especially if the porting tools are made in house. You have to hope, that when moving stuff engine to engine that 

-the model stays intact
-the rig is still there 
-its uv map is still there
-the texture is still there

And this isnt even guaranteed. As you may have some models that work. And others dont. And if you have a computer crash transferring the model. And if no backups were made. That model might be toast. Left to be built from the ground up. And sometimes it takes less time to freshly rebuild things if the tools just arent working. 

Now. Back to what i was talking about and to merge porting with my original point. “All this doesnt sound that bad” you say “game freak has a team of 200 people. This should take no time at all!” Well. Out of those 200 people. Not all of them are modelers, or programmers. You may have a handful of 20 programmers, and 20 modelers, and even then thats a bit generous, as teams are split up usually. 

Now. Even with this team of maybe 10 modelers working on a pokemon each. And somehow a port comes over just fine. Heres the big catch. Porting is not a done deal. Even if they are using the hi poly model and the improved textures from lets go and pokemon go. Theres still a few gaping holes. The rig and weight panting, which relates to the model. 

Starting with a note on textures. Even if they are using the improved textures. There is still a very, very good chance that they had to be updated. Which takes even more time that a texture artist has to deal with. But we’re looking at a best case scenario.  

Have you ever wondered why some animations seemed so stiff, and very limited? Well. I’m gonna explain why and how it relates to the model.  

 You see, in the 3d realm. Animations work based on a rig. A rig is pretty much a skeleton of a model. The more advanced a rig is, the more flexible it can be and the more advanced things it can do. However. A rig by itself, has no way to interact with with a mesh unless it is parented (ie, joined to) and how this parenting works with rigs. Is that you pair it. And assign weights to the mesh for each bone. Say a scale from blue to red. Blue being the bone doesnt effect that mesh area at all to red being it fully effects it.  This is to make sure when you bend the arm of a rig, say at the elbow, it doesnt cause the knee of the mesh to stretch out with it.

What does this mean for the current models and stiff animation? Well. Weight painting tends to work on a face-by-face basis. As the more faces you have, the higher poly it is, the better and more natural looking the mesh will look when animated. Now, the 3ds though great. Was not a powerful machine. And certain companies can use limited hardware better then others. When these  new pokemon were being developed. It is very likely that these models were made with the 3ds limited specifications in mind. Thus, corners were cut and the only what was necessary  to keep things looking nice, were left and what wasnt, was cut. This was fine for the handhelds, as having a more, lesser experience was normal compared to the main consoles. 

This is fine. However. There is a huge issue with this. With these cut models, the rigs are cut down as well as it just makes things easier, saves space and memory. However. When you bring these models made for a cut down experience over to a console, where that full experience is now completely expected is when the issues start to pile up. 

With a limited rig, you can do a lot, a lot more then you think, however, sometimes it isn’t enough. And changes have to be made. To do this, the rig *and* model have to be changed. Increasing poly counts, and depending on the program. Adjusting the rig, *completely* thrashes all the weight panting, and sometimes, the entire rig might even have to be redone, which means *animations* have to be redone and oh dear. The model was adjusted, which means that now that old uv unwrap, might be broken now, so that has to be fixed and with it, that old texture has a chance of not fitting and working right! As theres now all the sudden this new mesh that wasn’t there before and now it is here.

And to top it all off, a lot of these models likely have to be cleared off by someone or checked! And if that person doesn’t like it, they have to go back and fix it! And thats not even factoring in the occasional computer crash, corruption, and the other things the modelers have to work on and finally, most importantly of all!!!!!!

MONEY!!!!!!

I’m sure a lot of devs at game freak likely wanted to make a full dex but a lot of things at offices have a chain of command. And a lot of these things i mentioned are done with corners cut to made money or did what they could with what ever they had. Ie, the bare necessaries to get the game out on holiday season to maximize profit with the nintendo switch lite especially. Which sucks! But, companies are companies

And finally. To break it down.. to say 10 modelers. 5 are likely working on assets, map pieces, and other characters and what not in the game. This leaves 5 for Pokémon, say they get one model fully functioning and working, 1 per 1 days, so 14 a week. Still comes out to 332 days. Just shy of a year. And thats factoring in if they went to work every day, on a non stop crunch, with no holidays or stopping. Its hard work, its not cheap. 

And truthfully. I kind of feel sorry for my modeling brethren. 

In the end i’m absolutely sure money won over and thats why we’re getting what we are getting.",0.53,0.0,71.0,0.0,0.0,7536.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

AITA for not forgiving my friend when her grandmother died?,65,AmItheAsshole,484,"Yadda yadda on mobile, you get it.

So a little over two years ago, my husband and I got married. We had been planning the wedding since before we got engaged (a bit cart before the horse) and had a date picked out over 1.5 years before the actual engagement. We picked 10/13/17, as it was a Friday the 13th in October, so super spooky, and in our favorite season. Not that it matters, but we got married young (me barely 22 and him almost 25). 

Annie, my old college roommate and one of my closest friends at that time was my maid of honor. I'm not a party person, so we didn't even have a wedding shower/bachelorette party, so she didn't even need to plan anything. 

Two weeks before my wedding, a different bridesmaid had to drop out due to taking finals she couldn't miss. That was fine, I had another friend I asked and he accepted. Then, less than a week before the wedding, my friend Annie dropped out of the wedding because her grandmother died and the memorial was the same day a couple hours earlier. (I found it weird they had it on Friday the 13th since her family is SUPER religious, but c'est la vie).

I completely understood her need to be there and know it was NOT her fault. I asked if she could try and make the reception at least, and she said she couldn't. I'll admit, I was really sad, but I got over it. 

However, after that, I didn't hear from her for some time. She never apologized and never initiated text conversations. 

She ended up getting married about a year and a half later, and while I was invited to the wedding, I wasn't part of her bridal party. I decided to forgo the wedding as I knew I would just bring negative energy and didn't want to ruin her day. At this point, we hadn't spoken since MY wedding. 

Lately, she's been trying to ""reach out"" by leaving comments on Instagram posts and liking Facebook statuses. I refuse to acknowledge her in any way, as she never apologized for how much hurt she put me through. She is trying to act like everything is normal (years after no contact) and never even texted me, just public comments. 

I want to reiterate that I am not mad at her for missing my wedding, I am hurt that she didn't make an effort to come to my reception and that she never reached out to me afterwards. 

So Reddit, AITA because I won't forgive her and plan on never talking to her again, even if she were to apologize?

EDIT: Many of you are thinking I want her to apologize for her grandmother's death. I just wished she would have apologized such as ""I'm sorry I couldn't be there with you, I wish I could have, but there were more pressing matters."" 

She never asked about my wedding after, she never brought up anything. I did check in with her and text her condolences and make sure she was alright.

UPDATE: I'm not going to reply to anyone anymore. If you think I'm TA, fine. That won't change how hurt and upset I was and still am. Feelings are more complicated than Reddit seems to comprehend.",0.52,0.0,59.0,0.0,0.0,2967.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

[No Spoilers] The Wendy's one-shot is a funny idea but I sincerely hope this is the last time they do something like this.,49,criticalrole,268,"I've been a critter since 2016, and for the most part it's been great to watch the show grow. However, I think I've finally hit a point where I'm questioning it a bit. I love the cast to death, I know it's their company, and I've certainly consumed indie content sponsored by big companies before, but this felt off somehow. One of the things that makes Critical Role special is the lack of the influence of big brands. No matter how big they've gotten they've always managed to keep things ""in the family"", so to speak, keeping even sponsorships low-key and relevant to tabletop and creators. The larger brands that they've worked with like Dark Horse, Blizzard, and Nerdist have at least always been in the nerd-sphere. Even the animated series is 100% fan funded, which is fucking amazing considering the scale, and was a watershed moment for this type of independent creation. But now... Wendy's? Really? On the surface it's hilarious, but to me it kind of feels like a departure from the values that CR has previously espoused. Wendy's isn't exactly an ethical company, and while these days it's pretty much impossible to avoid working even indirectly with unethical mega-corps, it's possible to not promote them. They are managing to keep it sort of tongue in cheek but to me it still feels off.

I am absolutely not hating on the cast or their company, and I know that there may very well be a good reason for them to accept that sweet, sweet burger money. I don't know their position and whether or not I would do the same were I in a similar one. I can't tell them what to do or how to run their business, and I still support them. I just wanted to share my own personal feelings on this and discuss it civilly. Feel free to disagree!

Edit: Welp, I got added to r/controversialclub for this post. That kind of makes me sad, I honestly didn’t think this would blow up and I didn’t think that my passing thoughts would be this inflammatory, but I suppose it’s fair and maybe I should have expected it. I will say that my mind has been changed somewhat from a lot of the excellent arguments in this thread and while I never really thought it was a big deal, I’m no longer concerned. I never meant to come off as gatekeepy and I certainly never thought that CR has “sold out”. At the end of the day I guess this is just growing pains for the company. I think it’s possible to be wistful and nostalgic for the “simpler times” while also feeling happy and grateful for the growth, and I think it’s okay to respectfully share those feelings. I love Critical Role and the cast and that’s never going to change, no matter how many fast food themed one shots they put out.

"I've been climbing hard with Baptiste, here are some notes.",0,OverwatchUniversity,83,"In fact, I've never climbed harder with anyone else. My play is non-traditional, at least from the posts that I see popping up on here. My Baptiste account placed 2700 and I've played 3 hours per night beginning on the day of his competitive release, and I just hit 3500 (43w-12l with him at the time of writing this post.) This is no fairy tail, I grinded the game as a Lucio main for 15 seasons so I have more hours tucked away than these 3 hours per night initially tell. That being said, I'm already confident in saying that my ability to climb with Baptiste has far surpassed my ability to climb on Lucio, or any other hero that I've tried climbing with on a smurf.

I'll spare you my notes on healing, cause statistically (according to Overbuff) I'm in the 'top 93%' for healing aka I'm rarely healing. Yet, I'm usually the main healer in my competitive games and no one seems to mind trading heals for winning fights earlier.

What I think Baptiste is best at, **is killing the enemy team.**

Each of Baptiste's abilities enable him to play aggressively at the beginning, and end of fights.

Beginning with his AOE 'Regenerative Burst,' this short cooldown means that Baptiste can heal enemy poke damage at the beginning of fights, *without using his Biotic Launcher*. This means that Baptiste has the luxury of being able to position aggressively to force the enemy out of position before a fight starts. Positioning aggressively in this scenario usually means near my frontline, when a typical non-mobile healer would be playing in the backline. **My goal is to get a kill during these early fight peaks**, but damaging the enemy to force them to take cover and take a route they weren't expecting to take is often enough to sway a fight.

Next, Baptiste's Immortality Field, aka '**The Almighty Lamp**' is great for countering large ults, but **also is good for relieving him of healing duty, to focus on damage.** I'm finding myself using them late in fights to save teammates, but instead of healing my 40 health teammates, I'll use that time to punish enemies that are often without a shield since it is late in the fight. **The positioning of his lamp is key** to this point, I'm constantly thinking of where I can tuck my lamp to hit the most of my teammates/deny LOS of the enemy so they can't destroy it, otherwise I'm forced to heal my teammates since I otherwise no longer have the value of killing the enemy, without trading my teammate.

Alternatively, his Immortality Field can be used as the enemy is setting up for the next fight. This is perfect on escort maps as I'm finding time to **tuck my Field to freely poke the enemy** as the rotate closer to the objective. By the time they reach it, it's off cooldown to deny an enemy's finish, or to set myself and a DPS up to freely poke under the safety of Immortality.

The combination of these abilities will often **secure kills before a fight starts**, especially if I'm able to get one of my teammates next to me to explore these new moments of safety/invulnerability. Having a soldier with you is a deadly combo, or a Hammond that can knock up the enemy in your line of sight makes for simple kills.

So to recap, Baptiste **EXCELLS as a DPS at the beginning of fights AND at the end of fights** because of these two abilities which unfortunately means that he needs to be healing mid fight. If he had a rocket launcher like Soldier, he would have consistent windows of opportunity for mid-fight picks on enemy squishies, but he does not. But what he does have, is an ult that allows him to kill all squishy targets in a well-aimed burst.

As many of you may have noticed, **Baptiste ult generation happens about twice as quick as normal ults**. Again, my play is non-traditional and I get my fair share of comments on my ult usage, but I'm finding that the best way to use his ult, is to use it as quickly as you get it, usually in a flank/high ground position that avoids the enemy shield.

I've talked about how **his mid-fight role is healing,** but **the exception** to this **is when Baptiste gets ult.** Aimed properly, Baptiste now has similar windows of opportunities that traditional DPS have, only that his skill requires raw hitscan aim where other DPS typically have the luxury of larger hitbox skills. As I'm leading up to ult midfight, I'm already positioning myself away from the frontline, typically towards a highground to take advantage of my boots, and get 2-3 bursts on the enemy before the enemy shield can react. This translate into 2-3 possible kills with perfect aim, but more realistically 1 kill on the enemy's backline.

The aim of posting my notes is not to get the average player to neglect healing, but to realize the full potential of Baptiste's kit and to realize that healing isn't necessary if you kill the enemy before they damage your teammates (this sounds like a meme, but Baptiste is the only true support that actually consistently has this capability.) I've seen so many posts turning players towards 'Baptiste's AMAZING healing potential,' discouraging players from playing aggressively, but the shooter in me (and my winrate smile) knows that the real juice to Baptiste's kit comes when you are fragging the enemies backline, and have properly honed your aim. Aim discipline leads to capable leadership, this is my case to you for exploring Baptiste as a hyper-aggressive, secondary support.

I've included links to my recent games which touch on these topics, please reference them and ask any questions, I'll do my best to answer them all.

A Chinese take on this...,0,hearthstone,773,"  

If you are already angry reading the title and shout racist slurs or “get the fuck out 50cent army” then this post is not for you. I trust I should have some faith in the gaming community. 

After seeing and hearing so much I think I have a say in this. 

I am a Chinese British citizen, born and raised in China later immigrated to the UK, have spent over 15 years in both countries, well versed in social and political issues and themes in both cultures. And above all, a hardcore gamer. PC and console (PS2 in the past now Xbox), lost count of games I have played, probably well over 500 by now. 

And of course I was a die-hard Blizzard fan. Started with Warcraft 3, Starcraft (fun memories of Chinese Internet cafes lol), Diablo 1,2, then WoW, then Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 in the last few years etc… 

**Blizzard in the West**

I said “was”, because I have seen the downfall of blizzard. Let me get this straight first, **I really hate the Chinese influence of gaming** in the West. Here, I mean gaming in general: micro-transactions, artistic direction (apparently some of the Hearthstone tuning of gore etc as of late). I, too, enjoyed the early days of PS2 story-driven, free unlockables, and limitless replayability without extra cost, no “early access”, “surprise mechanics”. It is absolutely disgraceful to see the likes of EA and Activation scamming young children and getting people addicted. 

China has a lot to blame for this, because of its monetary influence in these Western publishers. 

To me, and a lot of my gamer friends here in the UK, Blizzard have gone down hill since Diablo 3. They have become more money driven and egregious with their practices. With the merger of Activation and their public listing, I don’t need to say much more, I think we all know how to feel about the whole entity as a whole at present. 

**Blizzard in China**

If you grew up in China in the 90’s like me, you will know how much influence Blizzard games had on our generation. Briefly mentioned above, Internet cafes used to be absolutely rampant in the country. If you know anything about China, in the 90s’, it was very poor (many are still today as well), even in big cities where Internet cafes were present. So IP wasn’t a thing. Millions of pirate copies of Starcraft and Warcraft 3 (among many other popular RTS and first person shooters) were what the owners depended their livelihood of. Now IP is much more strongly protected in entertainment industry as a whole, my generation feel the guilt towards Blizzard. Blizzard made their childhood memories but we all stole from them. So microtransactions in something like Hearthstone could make money off people so easily (as someone who never spends a penny on these I was absolutely gobsmacked to hear a Chinese friend of mine dropping the equivalent of $300 into Hearthstone to just to get in). 

**Mobile Gaming**

Mobile gaming is so popular in China because of a number of reasons. To keep a simple: 1. They are not exposed to the “real gaming” we have the privilege to be. Like many in this community know, media control is ridiculous. Most of what you hear on the Internet about “Great Wall of China” is true, so I don’t need to elaborate; 2. Mobile cellular technology is more advanced in China, arguably more than the UK and US, even in the country side; 3. Lifestyle of people in cities are much more fast paced; 4. Most important, combined with number 1, no developer/publisher have the political or monetary power to compete with the giants such as Tencent and Netease. The likes of these most probably have a lot of say along with the official governmental bodies which give entertainment production the “go-ahead” to the marketplace. Yes, corruption can be involved. But maybe as a whole, the country may not be as corrupt as many may think (especially having seen how some gamers describe China since the incident). 

**Hong Kong is No Laughing Matter**

If you are Chinese, AND British like me, you wouldn’t be very rushed to making a conclusion on making a stance.

But I think, we, in the gaming community can sometimes be slightly naïve about geo-politics. After all, we game to escape from the reality, I get it. But hear me out.  

Many seem to be unaware, how HK was a colony of the British Empire in the first place. Put it simply, two Opium Wars. What are the Opium Wars? Quick links here: ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium\_Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars))

Basically the arrogant Qing Dynasty wouldn’t trade with any Western powers, so the empires sold the Chinese opium in order to open its gates. The Qing government tried to fight against them, but failed, signed the treaty and gave up Hong Kong. In the late Qing Dynasty, opium problem was epidemic in the country. All men smoked it and it fucked up the country. Government was corrupt, Chinese citizens were hopeless, if you are interested, just google “Century of Humiliation”.

The Brits ruled it for 156 years, introduced rule of law, capitalism. All good things of course, especially when China was controlled by the Communist Mao in the 20th century. But make no mistake, its prosperity is not because of its freedom, it’s because China was closed up (internal political turmoil etc.. more on this, search “Cultural Revolution”). 

Since 1997 the handover, China joined the WTO, cities like Shen Zhen and Guang Zhou gradually took the economic position of HK. Why would a Western company go to HK when it could directly reach over 1 billion consumers, so HK gradually became less relevant. 

For those of us that think HK was “free” under the UK rule, allow me to say you might be misled. A quick comparison: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong\_Kong\_1967\_leftist\_riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_leftist_riots), the HK police killed 51 people in the 1967 extreme leftist riot (or I could call “patriotic demonstration” if I was biased). And, most importantly, HK citizens never had universal suffrage under the British rule. The UK government thought they were “democratic”, because it was democratic in the British parliament, which directly appointed the Chief Executive of HK.  

China has been gradually extending its “claws” into HK’s political and legislative system, I agree, hence I am supportive of the initial march by millions of citizens. But at the same time China is not as totalitarian as many make it out to be. I wish HK’s rule of law and relative freedom of speech never goes away, but I am also aware, Hong Kong (and especially Hong Kong) is and should always be China’s Hong Kong. 

I am over simplifying here, it’s a gaming community after all. But more on this, feel free to challenge/provide your thoughts.  

**Western Reaction on the Matter**

What happened, is a clash to cultures. 

After watching the most vocal gaming YouTubers’ reaction on the matter, YongYea, The Quertering, AngryJoe, Jimquisition, Layman Gaming, HeelvsBabyface etc., it made me realise that the Western gaming community at large can be quite politically unaware.

All of these guys I absolute admire, I subscribe to them, voice of the community, absolutely. But I don’t agree with some of their direct/indirect encouragement of protesting for “freedom of HK”.  

For some reason, the US and UK reaction of the HK matter has been the most one-sided story I have seen since my day one in UK. So to this degree, I don’t blame anyone’s responsive stance to stand for HK. But if you are really curious, I suggest you to google around, try to see the other side of the story on YouTube, see how other democratic Chinese spoken societies (Taiwan, Singapore) react to the whole thing, and what extreme violence has been committed lately, and also think, if the same thing happened here in the UK or US, what would the police do. 

I think making fun of Blizzard and China’s Pooh can be fun, but I think this advocacy can be “cheap”, we have very little to lose, but if people get really misled politically, many could die (need I say more). 

Note earlier I said “clash of cultures”. Believe me, a lot of reaction coming from mainland China towards NBA, South Park, Blizzard are not made by the government. Much of it is very negative, extreme even. I don’t agree the kind of rhetoric, but I can understand the rationale. 

To most of Chinese people, family is the upmost political correctness, like the Freedom of Speech, or Race Equality. To many, the unity of the country and the culture is the bigger “family”. So separate a part from its land is a fantasy, just like genocide is unimaginable now in today’s UK or USA. China has been relatively “homogenous”. The Chinese don’t value the latter two as much, because it didn’t have race relation troubles in its history, at least in the last 200 years. But if Race Relations cannot be kept in the USA, the country would break apart. If you don’t believe me, ask a Singaporean Chinese, Malaysian Chinese, Taiwanese Chinese, or even a British/American born Chinese, how important the unity of culture and the unity of family is to them.  

So for a foreign entity (like NBA or potentially Blizzard), who do not understand anything I have said above, to say stand with HK, is the greatest insult to the Chinese people. Hence the reaction or likely reaction in Blizzard’s case. 

I agree, that Chinese people are more sensitive on some issues than they should be, and not just boycott everything that touches their feelings. But again, you have to understand what it has been through in the last 200 years. And just a thought, how many countries have China invaded ever?  

This is why the Chinese think we the West are the bully and downright ignorant, and why we in the West think the Chinese commies are the bully.  

**Blizzard’s Weibo Post**

From the wording of the original post, in Chinese, I can see that it was probably written by a Chinese official. Mark Kern highlighted this in his live stream with The Quartering, and I think he might be right. The tone is very much a communist official’s tone, just like the kind you see on everyday media in China. But I think this is Blizzard using its “China knowledge”, because it understands the market (as per above), so doing the pre-damage controlling. I also think they should have just pulled him off behind the scene and warn him like many YouTubers suggested, instead of all guns-blazing using Weibo to please the Chinese gamers. Blizzard underestimated the power of internet and people’s willingness to research in general. 

**How We Should Move On**

Finally, if you have been with me this far, I hope this gives you some insight. I am not telling you to not stand with HK, at the end of day that is your freedom. I am simply providing some insight and background to the whole story. I just think if you do, be aware of what you stand for, and why. Personally, both democracy and Freedom of Speech are relative. I enjoy voting for my government here in the UK, and I enjoy writing this post here on Reddit (probably not possible in China), but I also believe in reason, as well as the “overall positive attitude and hopefulness of the majority Chinese people under the regime”. Ask any foreign person who has been or lived in China. 

As for the Western game developer/publishers, including Blizzard, I think they should focus on the games first, not country. This is why Blizzard got so big in the first place in China, because it made good games. The “Cyberpunks” of today are probably being pirated somewhere in the even less developed world (this is also why gaming studios go online more and more, the potential player base is unimaginably massive), but just know: if you make good games, they will be your loyal paying players one day. 

China is no longer pirating games, but the gamers know when a good game is a good game. The mobile gamers of China, too, want the quality of games that we get to play. I think censoring is ok, and every country has its own censorship (even here in the West), but don’t forget, make a good game first. Make the Lich Kings, the Deckerd Cains of today first. 

If you are from China over the wall reading this, I want you to know: just be more confident in the culture, have some faith in its gaming community in the long term. Don’t boycott everything, the general public of the West don’t want China to be demolished all the time!

And if you are Tencent or NetEase, instead of bribing the officials in letting your shitty mobile version of everything through the Chinese internet, why not grow some balls. Put money in the long term gaming industry in the country, let the work do the talk. Sell the country and the culture through good games. 

I know all of this is a fantasy, but this is how I feel.",0.45,0.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,12747.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

A few minor updates to our rules,0,leagueoflegends,1,"Hello everyone! Got an update this time with some minor changes. 

**Personal Story rule**

We are lowering our personal story character count from 750 to 500. Meaning personal stories must have at least 500 characters, less than that will be removed. 

A while back we loosened this restriction from 1000 characters to 750, this is a follow up to that. One thing we noticed was that we were removing threads that were unique and gave a full description. 

**Call to Action rule**

We have changed the wording of the call to action rule from

>No calls to action - don't rile up the community to vote for/against something or to boycott/support a person/organization. This does not include polls or contests created FOR the subreddit.

to

>Attempting to rally the community to do a specific thing (vote for a poll, boycott something, support something, etc) is a call to action and will be removed. This does not include polls or contests created FOR the subreddit

The goal here was to provide some more clarity on what is covered by the rule. The intent remains the same, but we feel under this wording it comes across better. 

**Vote Manipulation Rule**

Another rewording here, going from 

>DO NOT:
> 
>* Ask for votes on your reddit submissions anywhere.
>* Brigade; this means ganging up on other users through voting and/or commenting on linked threads.
>* Tell others to upvote or downvote submissions or comments.
>* Share Reddit links with your friends either explicitly or implicitly asking them to upvote your content.
>* Ask or allude to giving your post ""attention"", say ""don't upvote this"", ""this will be downvoted"" or otherwise try to influence voting.

to

>[Cheating or attempting to manipulate voting](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or) may get your account banned from Reddit. Posts that have been found to be manipulated will be removed, and won't be reapproved. VM cannot be undone, you can only submit a new post.

>* Do not encourage friends/followers anywhere to upvote or downvote Reddit posts.

>* Do not brigade; this means ganging up on other users through voting and/or commenting on linked threads.

>* Do not ask for upvotes in the post, or say ""This will be downvoted, but..."".

The below section remains the same

>You can link or otherwise share your comments / links on social media, *[provided you follow the exact titling shown here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/9b2j3r/we_are_changing_our_vote_manipulation_rule/)* Any other titling will be removed. This format is: “I just posted ‘POST TITLE’ on Reddit.” followed by a link to your post.

When making this change we wanted to add a bit of information without making it too bulky. A brief introduction was added to explain what VM is and the potential consequences. Additionally, we added reddit's rules on VM into our rules to provide more information. Some of the other changes were to slightly shorten some of them (see point bullet 5 in old vs bullet 3 in new).

"Valve, you have lost 3 million unique players in last 6 months, at what point do you start givng a fuck about your most profitable game?",287,DotA2,623,"We are currently sitting at a measly number of 350k daily players, do you understand how low that actually is? To make it worse, League of Legends recently revealed their daily player base, as part of 10 year anniversary of LoL, their daily active player base seems to be 8 million. They are also the most watched game on twitch (yea guys, moba genre is not dead, dota is).

Gaben alone has networth of 4 billion dollars and there are only 300 people employed in his company, probably less than 10 people of those 300 are working on dota. Why doesnt Valve invest more into Dota and employ more people? People who would work in marketing, people who would work on new player experience, people who would work around Dota content in general, and finally a community manager?

People on this sub act as its impossible to bring new players in the game, saying moba genre is dead, saying dota 2 is too hard for new players when actually LoL is harder for new players to start since their game has much more things new players will have to worry about (2 additional spells for each hero, jungle creeps giving buffs, not a single hero has passive ability, runes and masteries and so on). People think marketing and advertising wouldnt work. As a guy who is currently studying marketing, I can assure you that with proper marketing and good product (which dota certainly is) you will be able to achieve your goals (in dota's case increasing the player base).

It seems to me that Valve has somehow given up on Dota, that they only want to reduce the number of players leaving and squeeze as much money from players until the game ''dies'' in a couple of years. This game is by far the best game I have ever played and I still hold the opinion that it can have A LOT more players than it currently has.


**I would greatly appreciate if you guys could read the post and state your opinion on this, rather than just blatantly downvoting and leaving the thread.**

Rare deserves a lot of praise and recognition for their development of Sea of Thieves,0,truegaming,174,"On this day of what will be the [biggest update to Sea of Thieves](https://youtu.be/xRbTaMStHIM) yet, I feel that outside of the SoT community, Rare is not getting the recognition they deserve when it comes to their continued development of the game. 

Rare chose to treat their biggest project in years as a service. The game launched with little content, instead giving players the tools they needed to create their own adventures in a sandbox shared-world. It could be debated back and forth whether this was the right move or not, but this was the decision they made. 

The countless additions and updates they've made to the game since launch were a direct result from feedback they've received from r/seaofthieves and their official forums. Due to this, the playerbase became increasingly happy with the direction Rare was taking the game, as it was literally exactly what they were asking for. They added new enemy AI threats, balanced combat, added new physics, new tools, improved many UI issues, added tons of new cosmetics, added a new ship type, new loot, map expansion, and more. You can see the full list [here](https://seaofnews.net/2019/02/06/whats-changed-in-sea-of-thieves/).

On top of this, Rare has been very transparent throughout the life of the game. They interact with the community on Reddit and the forums, they release weekly developer update videos, they host weekly streams where they discuss what's going on in the studio, etc. 

Rare did all of this with *zero* microtransactions. In a world where the vast majority of developers add microtransactions and loot boxes wherever they can, Rare has supported this game much more than most developers, and never asked for an extra dime. It's refreshing honestly. 

The Anniversary Update is one of the biggest updates I've seen for a game, adding an entire new faction, a new lore-based campaign, a new PvP mode, and much more. Not this update nor any of the updates and expansions have asked for any additional money, and you still can only purchase the in-game cosmetics through in-game gold. 

This is the direction this industry needs to move in. Good, honest, and transparent developers who cater to their audience by showing real love for their projects instead of implementing pay-to-win content and loot boxes. Hopefully this can be the future.",0.5,0.0,85.0,0.3,0.9,2329.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"OPM Breach Report is OUT.. ""failing to implement basic cybersecurity standards"" and dem's refuse to fund cybersecurity upgrades needed.",2,AskThe_Donald,32,"[In the GOP Press conference this morning, one of the items stated was how the Dem's were refusing to fund the needed upgrades for cyber security in our nation.](https://youtu.be/SWXwowuGhTg?t=900)

Now, they have released the investigative report, 4 years in coming, from the OPM hack that was so devastating to our nation and those working both overt and covert operations to keep our nation safe.

In this article on cyberscoop posted this morning:[Senate investigation finds agencies 'unprepared' to protect Americans' data](https://www.cyberscoop.com/senate-investigation-data-protection-opm-breach/)

>Federal agencies are “failing to implement basic cybersecurity standards” needed to protect Americans’ personal data and keep the nation’s secrets safe from hackers, a Senate investigation has concluded. The report, which drew on 10 years’ worth of inspector general reports at eight agencies, paints a picture of persistent neglect of standard network defense measures.

>It comes more than four years after the breach of the Office of Personnel Management, in which alleged Chinese hackers stole sensitive personal data on 22 million current and former federal employees. Lessons from that sweeping compromise of American security clearances still haven’t been heeded, according to the report from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs’ Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

>“Despite major data breaches like OPM, the federal government remains unprepared to confront the dynamic cyberthreats of today,” laments the report, which covered the departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, State and Transportation, as well as the Social Security Administration. In addition to DHS, the Senate subcommittee chose to review the seven agencies that the Office of Management rated the poorest on cybersecurity.

>“The federal government can, and must, do a better job of shoring up our defenses against the rising cybersecurity threats,” said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs the subcommittee.

Closing Statement.,11,Unexpected,411,"
Since 1996, 27th January has been a legally recognised day of remembrance in Germany.
In 2005, the United Nations declared January 27 to be International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust.
On this day in 1945, the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp was liberated by the Red Army.

Just before (between 17 and 23 January), 60,000 prisoners were evacuated and forced to go on a death march towards the west.
Only about 7,500 people, who were too sick or too weak to walk, were left behind .


Our project aims to commemorate the madness and inhumanity of the industrial mass murder of millions of people and to remember the victims.

All 3 minutes, we had one victim of the extermination camps posted with their name, date of birth, date and place of death.
Our databases were limited because we wanted to show you their faces.
As the archives of www.holocaust.cz were the most easily accessible for us, we featured a lot of victims of Czech descent.


Behind each of these names and photos was a human being who lost their life in an unbelievable cruelty.

Tanks will never be balanced until Riot change their philosophy on Armor/MR,3,leagueoflegends,163,"EDIT:

Hi Redditors, sorry for the late reply I posted that before going on my 12 hr work shift.

&#x200B;

Your responses make me really disappointed with this community. Most of you decided that I don't have a grasp of a basic fundamental of League of Legends and just went with the argument that I'm somehow less intelligent than you and use that to bash the post and don't add anything to the discussion.

&#x200B;

Yes, I do understand the basics of Effective HP, and even used on some calculations on this very post. The fact that I said armor have diminishing returns is because if you look on a vacuum, without considering armor as a multiplier for how effective your HP is, every point of armor does give less % damage reduction the most you have it.

&#x200B;

The whole point of this post is not to say that  the way resistances work at the moment is garbage and does not work, is to say that tying the value of the resistance as a factor for how effective your HP is, is flawed as a design because it's not simple and intuitive like every other stat in League.

&#x200B;

None of you can't tell for sure on a match how effective is a purchase of 30 armor is at a given time, because you need to factor in how much HP do you have, how much armor you had before you bought the 30 armor, if you have shields or if the enemy has armor penetration (Because that alters the curve for how effective you HP is).

&#x200B;

All I propose was a form for the Devs to create an easy to read and understand formula that would simplify the resistance calculation for % damage reduction. On my proposal, 5 armor would always be 1% damage reduction regardless of how much armor you already have. For me that just it, that was the only suggestion I gave, the rest was just speculations on how it would enable the devs to work more freely when balancing champions and items.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: I know what effective HP is, and armor/MR does give less % damage reduction the more you have it, doesn't matter if you still get tankier or your HP is more effective the more you have it, the fact is that the current damage formula dictates that the more of a resistance you have it the less % damage reduction you earn by every point of that resistance.**

&#x200B;

*PS: All I wanted was to create a discussion around ways for Riot to deal with the conundrum of balancing Tank items, as Riot decided to balance Tanks around items and at the present moment most of the Tanks are with a garbage winrate and playrate but I don't know how Riot can balance them without creating a must buy Tank item that can unintentionally create a Tank meta.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After watching Phreak's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJC3dTMnZV0) about base stats, it got me thinking that Riot's approach to armor and MR is fundamentally flawed and that is the root of the problem that makes it impossible to balance not only Tanks but all other classes.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The main issue is that resistances gives diminishing returns the more you have it, that creates a ripple that makes squishy classes have a lot more benefit from base resistances because they will most of the time end up with decent armor and MR values at level 18, while forcing the hands of the devs to balance Tanks with items instead of base values.

&#x200B;

Which causes some mind-boggling values such as:

* Nami *(Ranged champion with healing spells)*: **97** armor at lvl 18.
* Mordekaiser *(Melee champion with no CC and low MS)*: **88.8** armor at lvl 18.
* Caitlyn *(Long range ADC with self-peel and CC)*: **87.5** armor at lvl 18.
* Garen *(Melee champion, no gap closer and no long-range spells)*: **87** amor at lvl 18

&#x200B;

And even when melee and Tank champions have more armor values than squishy champions, is not even that much. All champions hover around 100 armor. This is because devs expect Tank champions to buy a lot of Tank items to become beefier, but if Tank champions are balanced around how good the items that provide armor/MR are, that is also a flawed design.

&#x200B;

Imagine that Riot suddenly buff all the armor and MR items on the game, why wouldn't an assassin or ADC buy those items and become an unkillable and high DPS champion with self-peel and CC to boot? *(That pretty much resume all the Tank metas we had so far)*

&#x200B;

What I mean by that is: ***Everyone else benefits more from strong armor/HP/MR items than the class they were supposed to be made for.***

&#x200B;

So, how to even fix that? If Riot buff Tank items everyone else will abuse it, and if Riot just buff Tanks resistances it will only make Tanks not want to buy armor or MR since it would be a waste of gold because of the diminishing returns.

\#**My proposal is to change the damage formula and armor/MR items, as well as remove the resistance scaling from the level up.**

&#x200B;

* **Damage reduction formula: Making it more linear and simple for players while creating more room for the devs to balance damage output.**

Damage reduction formula: *100/100+armor = damage dealt*

*050 armor = 100/150 =* ***0.66*** *(34% damage reduction)*

*100 armor = 100/200 =* ***0.50*** *(50% damage reduction)*

*200 armor = 100/300 =* ***0.33*** *(67% damage reduction)*

*400 armor = 100/500 =* ***0.20*** *(80% damage reduction)*

&#x200B;

*New damage reduction formula: 1.0 - \[(armor/5) / 100\]  = damage reduction*

*050 armor = 1.0 - \[(50/5) / 100\] = 1.0 - 0.1 =* ***0.9*** *(10% damage reduction)*

*100 armor =* ***0.8*** *(20% damage reduction)*

*200 armor =* ***0.6*** *(40% damage reduction)*

*400 armor =* ***0.2*** *(80% damage reduction)*

&#x200B;

*\*With the new damage reduction formula, a 400 max armor limit should be set. The same way AS and CDR have limits.*

* **Base Stats change: Balancing champions with HP growth as Phreak suggested in his video.**

&#x200B;

*First I'll set some examples to help visualize how champions can be balanced without resistance growth:*

&#x200B;

*. Caitlyn*

*\*old HP = 481(+91 per level) = 2028 at level 18*

*\*old* AR = 028(+3.5 per level) = 87.5 at level 18 (47% damage reduction)

*\*old* Physical effective HP = 3802 at level 18 with no items.

&#x200B;

*\*new* HP = 800(+100 per level) = 2500 at level 18

*\*new* AR = 150(+0.0 per level) = 150 at level 18 (30% damage reduction)

*\*new* Physical effective HP = 3500 at level 18 with no items.

&#x200B;

. Mordekaiser

*\*old* HP = 530(+78 per level) = 1856 at level 18

*\*old* AR = 025(+3.75 per level) = 88.8 at level 18 (47% damage reduction)

*\*old* Physical effective HP = 3504 at level 18 with no items.

&#x200B;

*\*new* HP = 950(+50 per level) = 1800 at level 18

*\*new* AR = 200(+0.0 per level) = 200 at level 18 (40% damage reduction)

*\*new* Physical effective HP = 3000 at level 18 with no items.

&#x200B;

*\* With the static resistance values champions can be better balanced around their HP pools, and with more HP every resistance point is more meaningful and valuable.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* **Item changes: Making buying resistances a satisfying and meaningful decision.**

&#x200B;

To be able to better balance Tank items, Riot can now use the base resistance values as a multiplier for Tank oriented items without giving too much resistance for squishy champions. To demonstrate this I'll show some examples of how it can be an effective tool:

&#x200B;

. Armor cloth:

*\*old* AR = 15 *(anything from 4% to 1% damage reduction depending on how much armor you have)*

*\*new* AR = 10 (always 2% damage reduction)

&#x200B;

. Frozen Heart

*\*old* AR = 100 (anything from 17% to 5% damage reduction)

*\*new* AR = 25 + (20% base armor) = +55 on Caitlyn (11% damage reduction) or +75 on Mordekaiser (15% damage reduction)

&#x200B;

. Thornmail

*\*old* AR = 80 (anything from 14% to 4% damage reduction)

*\*new* AR = 30% base armor = +45 on Caitlyn (9% damage reduction) or +75 on Mordekaiser (15% damage reduction)

&#x200B;

. Raduin's Omen

*\*old* AR = 60 (anything from 11% to 3% damage reduction)

*\*new* AR = 50 (always 10% damage reduction)

&#x200B;

\* ***This change can also help balance Lethality and Armor Penetration. Lethality can go back to not scaling anymore and reducing a flat amount of armor, while armor penetration can multiply the total armor value of the champion.***

&#x200B;

. Serrated Dirk

*\*old* = +10 Lethality = Reduce enemies armor by 6.22 to 10 (increase anything from 2% to 0.6% damage dealt)

*\*new* = +15 Lethality = Reduce enemies armor by 15 (increase damage dealt 3%)

&#x200B;

. Last Whisper

*\*old* = +20% armor pen. = Reduce armor anywhere from 20 - 80 (Increase between 5% to 6.25% damage dealt)

*\*new* = +25% armor pen. = Reduce armor anywhere from 25 to 100 (Increase between 5% to 20% damage dealt)

&#x200B;

##Introduction

Despite CERA's best efforts to contain the outbreak at the Washington National Airport, the situation quickly became untenable, resulting in the airport being coated in DC-62 and subsequently abandoned. When the Black Tusk arrived in D.C., they set up shop in the now derelict airport. 

&nbsp;

It's up to you and seven friends to flush them out and you will be challenged on not only your skill but also on your ability to analyze, adapt, and cooperate. Unique bosses, with the most exotic mechanics and technology you've ever faced in The Division 2, are waiting for you.

&nbsp;

**To start the raid,** players will need to speak with the helicopter pilot at the Base of Operations. This unlocks a new raid tab on the social menu, allowing everyone to start building their raid groups.

##Operation Dark Hours: Race to World First

While anyone can pit themselves against the Raid, only one team can be the first to beat it. Those team members are the Elite of the Special Homeland Division and History will remember them.

&nbsp;

In their honor, the first team that beats the final boss of the Raid will be immortalized in the White House itself. All eight players, and their usernames*, will be featured on a special painting that will be placed on one of the White House walls, near the Clan room. This painting will be visible to all players, not only the players that completed the Raid.

Those that want to shit all over the games can do so in either the specified megathread, or go and use the entire Pokemon subreddit. But the constant memeing and moaning of any tiny detail people can get hold of is ruining the fun for everyone else. I keep coming on to reddit getting ready to amp myself up for the game's release and I just see a wall of negativity in the comments about literally any aspect you can think of.

I get it, people are unhappy about Dexit. Hell, I went through every single game generation last year and caught them all so I could have living dex, and I can't bring those across. But you also couldn't bring your Pokemon over until you'd beat the elite four in nearly every other game, or at least had to wait months for Pokemon Bank support - so your first playthrough would only include Pokemon in that region's Dex. Personally, I'm looking forward to it as it makes the competitive scene a lot more accessible for me.

What an interesting morning,0,orangetheory,44,"FYI to the people who get mad at everything:

f u :)

No need to explain myself to the OTF police 🚔🚨 #keepburning

My alarm went off at 5am, and I snoozed it until I peeked at my phone one last time at 6:03am. As I laid comfortably with my eyes gracefully shut in bed at 6:03, I quickly realized that I have a class at 6:15. My eyes bounced open and I ran out the door practicing what my 6 speeding tickets this year taught me— don’t hit anyone.

I get to class just as everyone is giving high fives. I start wondering why everything looks so blurry. I find out that I forgot to put my contacts on, which makes me happy because I actually didn’t hit anyone on the way to the studio. I make it through the rowing block (barely). I struggle to find my station in the weight floor because I’m so blind, but a friendly face grabs me and walks me to my station only for me to catch a glimpse of myself at the weight floor mirror. 

Bed head. Backwards shorts. Mis-matched shoes. It was a mess, but I embraced it. I work through the weight floor. I actually had shoulder pain, so I used options for a few of the exercises.

An Update to the Subreddit Rules,65,totalwar,791,"Hey Everyone, 

As some of you have noticed, a new rule has appeared on the sidebar. This rule was created in response to a rising rate of NSFW content being posted on the subreddit after the release of Total War: Three Kingdoms.

In the past, this is not something we've needed to address and so there was not a specific rule for it. Over the past 2-3 weeks we've moderated multiple posts of this nature and cited rule #1, ""All posts must be related to the Total War series. I feel that while this is somewhat true, the logic is tenuous and in need of a more concrete solution. 

To that end this rule has been added: 

>Posts must be SFW.

>Posts & Comments
>Reported as: NSFW Content.

>/r/TotalWar is a SFW subreddit, therefore, all posts must also be generally SFW. Nudity or other overtly sexual content is not allowed and will be removed at the moderators' discretion.

This rule will be enforced effective immediately.

To read our full rules and clarifications see this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/about/rules/

Thank you for reading, 

The /r/Totalwar Mods

**NOTE**: This was meant to be an edit to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/c2lq6g/update_to_sub_rules) to clarify our wording and intention, but mistakes were made. Leaving this here so the comments are preserved.",0.52,0.0,32.0,0.0,0.0,1315.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Because of all of today's discourse, I decided to actually research the original quotes that people are referencing. Here are my findings.",33,pokemon,127,"Hi all, I'm really getting annoyed by the more... toxic side of the fanbase. I don't post on this subreddit often, but I felt like this would be the most appropriate place to post this for visibility. Strap in, because this'll be a long one.

 So, after seeing all the discourse today on Twitter about #gamefreaklied, I thought maybe people were taking things a liiitle too far, but besides that I realized that everyone's been pulling the ""Brand-New Models"" and ""High Quality Animations"" cards since those stories broke and maaaybe the original message was lost in the rhetoric. So I decided to go back to the original sources of each quote and actually determine whether or not they were

1. even quoted correctly

and

2. actually lies.

So let's start with the ""rebuilt the models from scratch"" stuff. Upon searching it up, I found [this Polygon article](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/7/13/20693069/pokemon-sword-shield-pokedex-limited-game-freak-statement-nintendo-switch), which cites [this NintendoEverything article](https://nintendoeverything.com/game-freak-elaborates-on-pokemon-sword-shields-inability-to-bring-in-pokemon-not-in-the-galar-pokedex-pokemon-home-more/), which cites [this Silliconera translation](https://www.siliconera.com/2019/06/16/game-freak-says-it-will-be-hard-for-all-pokemon-to-appear-even-in-games-after-pokemon-sword-shield/) of [this Famitsu interview](https://www.famitsu.com/news/201906/13177936.html). 

That’s already a lot of hoops to get though for an actual sauce, but I read through all of them to compare (and what I could of the original interview, but I’m disregarding that because Google Translate is hella spotty). The Silliconera translation and NE article are pretty much the same, but the Polygon article is slightly different. I mean, it makes sense that you would probably want to mix things around a bit to seem like you’re not just repeating the story over again. The BIG problem with this, is that in this instance, sites kept citing other sites, and self-perpetuated the rumor. Want to know where that “rebuilding all the models from scratch” line came from? Me too, because it sure wasn’t from the original interview they’re all citing. Here is the excerpt from Silliconera:

	_ “According to Ohmori, even in Pokemon Sun & Moon, bringing in every Pokemon was something barely manageable, and with Pokemon Sword & Shield and the need to redo models, and so they had to make a decision. However, Ohmori says that despite this, the Wild Areas and story will have quite a bit of content to make up for it.”_

That’s it. That’s the only mention of models throughout the entire translation.

Did they ever say they needed to redo them from scratch? Nope.

Where did it come from then?

Well, we have a daisy chain of events.

1. Silliconera, as far as I can tell, was the first to report on this interview (Not sure if they were the translators but they are the farthest back in this citation chain).

2. NintendoEverything, cites SE, is mostly the same but simplifies a few of the topics into bullet points. The most important part of this is that they put “With Pokemon Sword/Shield and the need to redo models, they had to make a decision” as its own bullet point.
3. Polygon then cites the NE article (and also [this reddit post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/cb2z26/japanese_interview_from_famitsu_reveals_all_old/), which I’ll get to in a bit.), but what’s important here is their headline. It reads:

##No, Pokemon Sword and Shield is not reusing models from recent Pokemon games
#All models were remade from scratch, says Game Freak

So, there’s a big problem with this: they _literally never said that_.  I don’t know if this was supposed to be clickbait or whatever, but that title is straight up false. That doesn’t matter though, because other news sites ATE. IT. UP.

[Newsweek]( https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-sword-shield-models-controversy-1449299)

[IGN]( https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/14/pokemon-sword-and-shield-arent-recycling-3d-models-game-freak-confirms)

[vg247]( https://www.vg247.com/2019/07/14/pokemon-models-pokemon-sword-shield-brand-new/)

[Eurogamer]( https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-14-game-freak-isnt-recycling-3ds-models-in-pokemon-sword-and-shield-after-all)

They ALL reference Polygon. 

They also reference that reddit post I mentioned, but that just cites the NintendoEverything article, with the exception of the first paragraph, which is by the OP of the post. It reads:

""_UPDATE: Holy Arceus this blew up. Really didn't think this would reach so many people to thousands of Twitter retweets and even a Polygon article. The best way to explain all the questions is with a full explaination. Obviously everything stated in the article is not my own words so let's focus on the intro paragraph of my own. The whole reason I researched this topic in the first place was due to listening to an episode of Comicbook.com's Pokemon podcast (Episode 10 around the 40 minute mark) about a Japanese magazine interview. Most of the information from my paragraph was lifted from that including the mention of framerates and quality, the line about starting from scratch, and about Dynamax models. Also, Gamefreak has gone on record that they have 2 development teams, Team A is Town, B is Pokemon. Obviously no one really knows if this is true until we have the game in our hands and search the game files._

_When they switched over from 3DS to Nintendo Switch, the framerates and quality were both different. In this article they reveal that when they went to transfer models and move animations into SS they didn't transfer over right forcing them to rebuild them by scratch. Keep in mind Game Freak only has 143 employees, only half of which are working on Pokemon, the other half on Town. So basically while the same animations of the Pokemon themselves are copied and pasted, most if not all Pokemon models had to be redone. On top of that issue, Dynamaxing forces Gamefreak to produce extra models for each and every Pokemon, because you can't just take the same model and increase it's size by 10 and expect it to look even half decent_.”

So, their only source for that info was the 10th episode of Comicbook.com’s Pokemon Podcast. See, the funny thing about that is that I actually tried to find it to see what the original quote was and what they sourced, but when I checked their YT channel it literally just went from ep. 9 to ep. 11. [Here’s a screenshot.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552969201891934221/644281484060131369/unknown.png) Dunno if they unlisted it for some reason, but it still means I can’t actually cite what they actually said. 

**Anyways, the main takeaway from this is that Polygon’s faulty reporting gave us the “we remade the models from scratch” line, no one ever actually said it. Considering people have been pedaling that one for months, I’d say that’s a pretty big find.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANYWAYS, let’s move on to everyone’s favorite: “high quality animations”. My point in this section is to show that the line was taken out of context and reworded unintentionally to sound like they sacrificed pokemon for higher-quality animations. I’m going to indicate now that my findings indicate that this misquote got traction because not enough people bothered to read anything but the “title” (I’ll elaborate in a moment).

So, for this quote, the main article sourced was [this USGamer interview](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-interview). It’s a fairly standard interview. It was cited by all the news outlets that reported on it, but what did they actually say in it?

Well, the only actual mention of animations is in this paragraph:

	_” There are a couple of different parts to the thinking behind it, but really the biggest reason for it is just the sheer number of Pokemon. We already have well over 800 Pokemon species, and there's going to be more added in these games. And now that they're on the Nintendo Switch, we're creating it with much higher fidelity with higher quality animations. But even more than that, it's coming down to the battle system. We're making sure we can keep everything balanced and give all the Pokemon that appear in the games a chance to shine.”_

He says the reason for cuts was mostly based on the sheer amount of Pokemon. I mean, that seemed pretty obvious from the beginning. The rest of the paragraph is just fluff, if I’m being honest. They’re basically just saying “the game is on an HD console now, we have to make refinements”. Whether they did or not isn’t the point; the point is that nowhere in this interview did they say that Pokemon were sacrificed for better animations. They never made an excuse, or did any of the stuff people keep accusing them of. 
So where did the famous words come from? Well, when I was looking for that article I stumbled across [this video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAydd_b8Xlo), and many others like it (there are quite a few). What do they all have in common? They site [this tweet](https://twitter.com/serebiinet/status/1138878900421967872?lang=en) by Serebii, which reads:

_”Serebii Note: In an interview with @USgamernet, Junichi Masuda reaffirms that the sheer volume of high quality animations and desire to balance further resulted in the decision to block transfer of some Pokémon Interview”_

This is the “title” I was referring to earlier. People read this title without reading the article (pretty similar to the Polygon situation, now that I think about it), and immediately made their judgements. I definitely have reason to believe that this this tweet’s miswording snowballed into that famous catchphrase. It does make it sound worse than it is, and I really think they were just trying to fit it into Twitter’s character limit. Obviously no harm was meant by Serebii, it’s just an honest mistake. But those videos cited it, and the people watching those videos also probably wouldn’t have gone back to read the article because obviously no one’s got time for that (/s).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for reading that, hopefully it clears the air a bit. It only took a couple hours to research and write, and I hope it was worth it lol.

[OFFICIAL] 2x Rewards Explained,0,ClashRoyale,505,"Hey everyone!

There is a lot of discussion around the new Trophy Road rewards and rightly so. Myself and Seth made a comment during TV Royale – “the rewards are roughly 2x larger” so we wanted to clear up what we meant by that.

First off, your concerns are valid. When we said “more rewards”, you aren’t crazy for thinking you would get more of **the same rewards**.

**While there** ***are*** **more rewards in total, they take a different form than before and that can make it feel like we took something away.**

The ‘2x rewards’ comment came from our game economy spreadsheets that convert all the rewards into a neutral 'Gem value'. The new rewards are pretty large when converted into this neutral value, but you are correct to notice that it’s not directly doubling the Rares and Epics you used to receive.

Our goal with the 4k+ rewards was to more heavily emphasize Gold to enable & encourage upgrades – after all, you’ll want to upgrade your cards to push further on the Trophy Road. A lot of the rewards have been converted from heavy stacks of Rares and Epics into much more Gold and Trade Tokens to allow you to upgrade the cards you want.

Here’s an example of the rewards for a player who goes from 4000 - 5225 Trophies in a League Season before and after the changes:

|OLD|NEW|
|:-|:-|
|6000 Gold|14,300 Gold|
|120 Commons|455 Commons|
|150 Rares|115 Rares|
|30 Epics|5 Epics|
|1 Legendary|1 Legendary|
||1 x Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary Trade Token|
||72 hours of 2x Chest Speed Up Boost\*|

\**(the full effect of this will be felt upon a Season reset - multiple stacked boosts are only awarded when hitting a new Arena and weren't part of the Trophy Road release)*

**As you can see, you get more than 2x as much Gold and nearly 4x as many Commons.**

We realise that many players relied on the Season Draft chest to provide a much needed burst of Epics, and therefore found the drop in Epics to be concerning. However, as you advance higher in Trophy Road, the extra Magical and Legendary King’s Chest provide more Epics than the old chest.

**But many players are concerned that’s too high for them to push.**

While the Gem value is higher than the old Draft Chest, we think it’s fair to critique the lack of Epics. We basically converted the Epics to much more Gold, Commons, and Trade Tokens, but not every player wants or needs those resources. For some players, they would rather have 20 Epics than 10,000 Gold, so we understand your frustration.

What we expect from the new system is that players ***will*** be hitting these higher Trophies, and this is also why we designed the rewards this way (and why we introduced Trophy Gates). We want players to progress further in Trophies than they have before. If people are to gain hundreds more Trophies than before, it’s likely they would accumulate more rewards than before.

Obviously, the April Update has only been out for almost 3 days and players may not be feeling these changes right away. By the end of the month, we will have a better idea of where players will end up and can adjust the rewards accordingly. **The Trophy Road rewards from 4000+ are not locked in stone forever – it’s something that we hope to update and change regularly in the future with your feedback and our internal data.**

If we end up being wrong, and players do not end up climbing or progressing in the Trophy Road as much as we think they will, then of course we will dig into our data and change them to give you the best ladder experience.

**We also wanted to point out that after the Season reset, you will be able to collect the new Season rewards from 4000+ to your new reset Trophy level. You don't need to drop down to 4000 Trophies to collect every reward from 4000+.**

Again, thanks to everyone for your feedback, we understand and agree with the concerns.

"A question to women, how do you find reading books by male authors?",2,Fantasy,355,"Hope i don't get labelled a sexist because i know how easy it is throw the word around, but I'll just portray my experience and ask my question.

I only started reading books less than 2 years ago, and i wasn't involved in any reading communities and don't even know people irl who read to discuss stuff with. So i pretty much got in without any biases. I mostly read books without knowing the author or paying much attention to their name.
But after reading more than a 100 books since then, i feel like i haven't enjoyed books written by women as much (in general). Not too sure exactly why, i think maybe the often flowery/romantic is part of it ? prose and I've maybe slightly more emphasis on romance. Also the close character interactions are well written generally (however as stated too flowery and emotional for me) but the ""badass"" especially when a male character is involved sometimes feel a bit cringy.
I feel like all the flowery emotional bits might work well in female POVs, but i found it more annoying when its the same for male POVs as well.

So my question is, do women find books by men way too crude/ unemotional especially is it's from a female POV.

and for the men, anyone else feels the same way i do ?
or am i just weird and a misogynistic sexist pig who is subconsciously influenced and controlled by the patriarchy lol ? 

I chose this sub because 90% of the books i read are fantasy books. so i want the opinion of those more familiar with the genre 

Edit: What i got from this thread was this:

-Many of the female authored books i read were YA, and most YA books i liked were by one or two of my favourite male author. So there is a good chance i just don't like YA.

-Female writers (in general) write character focused books, and do characters well, but generally maybe not as strong in terms of plot or world building and vice versa for men. Since i like the magic, plot and world building more than characters I've found books by men more appealing in general

-I got loads of recommendations to books i might like, thanks for the recommendations!

-I might be partially subconsciously biased to some degree, so I'm kind of a sexist misogynist. sorry women, i always try not to be but i guess i was corrupted a bit by the system.

-Men in general, and myself obviously aren't that into romance and being too emotional?, so romance kinda puts me off.",0.5,0.0,67.0,0.0,0.1,2386.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

A double standard between Fnatic and Team Liquid?,17,leagueoflegends,214,"When TL picks Sona/Taric it is flamed everyone in the community.

When Fnatic picks Garen/Yuumi it is praised by everyone.

I saw something similar with rift rivals, G2 is praised when they pick off meta stuff but TL beating them with that comp is just them trolling.

Which I find kinda bullshit because G2's players are good enough that I think they could win with almost any team comp. So while I do think they were NOT playing seriously at rift rivals, I do think it is a disservice to G2 to think that even a ""troll comp"" was something they could not beat anyone with.

I just find it odd (by odd i mean hypocritical) for a specific group of people to have such double standards.

I get this is a common thing in sports, I understand it is not all EU players, or what not. I am just generalizing to make a point.

But I think it should be said that I find it fascinating the lengths people will go to, to explain away any fault.

Garen/Yuumi is an oppressive lane that can win games by brute force and the inabillity to die. Super hype.

Sona/Taric is a boring, snoozefest, that takes zero skill.

Yet while garen does indeed make for more enjoyable viewing, it is not by any means any less of a easy way to auto win lane. Arguably it would take more skill to pilot sona through early laning then garen.

I think Fnatic is one of the best teams in the world right now. But I think this double standard by specific people should be called out.

Loot Drops - Consolidated Feedback Megathread,0,AnthemTheGame,1549,"Hello, Freelancers! Yesterday, we kept an eye on the recent spate of loot-related threads and wanted them to have their time on the front page. However, we wanted to work on consolidating some of that feedback into a single active megathread, especially after we've had a significant amount of requests for a megathread.

To help facilitate that, we've established a thread allowing for focused feedback and discussion. For the time being, we'll redirect future loot discussion threads made to this megathread while it's active and stickied. It will stay up for a period of time then be unstickied. After that, new loot threads can be made. 

---

Here are some examples on ongoing discussions that serve as examples of good feedback: 

[To all the people defending the low droprates and convoluted inscription system, saying ""we just want free amazing loot ASAP"", let's teach you some math.](https://redd.it/az9lmt)

[[Constructive Feedback With Charts/Graphs] Progression is Fundamentally Broken, But it Can Be Fixed! Solutions and thoughts inside!](https://redd.it/aytu0z)

[Enough Is Enough. This loot discussion shouldn't even be happening. It's ridiculous.](https://redd.it/azep9f) 

[Bioware, can you please meet us in the middle with the loot?](https://redd.it/az7ypd)

[Constructive Criticism: My Biggest Issue with Anthem Is That I Don't Feel the Game Respects My Time or Investment](https://redd.it/azde66)

Furthermore, [Chad Robertson, head of Live Service at BioWare has commented about the loot feedback on Twitter](https://twitter.com/crobertson_atx/status/1104506215986548736).

When commenting, please give feedback that is on-topic and preferably constructive in nature. Good feedback means talking about your *experience* with loot (the problem), instead of offering suggestions on what they should do differently. Your problem helps them find a solution; your suggestions don't tell them exactly what the problem is. Feedback about your play experience is inherently more valuable than the suggestions you have to offer on how to fix it.

**Please** do not spam. If you leave feedback for another aspect of the game, your comment may be removed. Thank you! ",0.45,0.0,45.0,0.0,0.0,2184.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Here’s how one random Level 359 player with 1100 hours in game is using his/her FO1st Membership... tl;dr,27,fo76,116,"This post isn’t to argue for the subscription or against it. My opinion is rather dry when it comes to that. It’s a frighin’ video game. No reason to get anyone’s panties in a bunch over anything regarding it. But that’s just me. 

Is it pay to win? Yeah, I guess so. It certainly isn’t just cosmetic. But before purchasing my 1 year subscription, I was already very high level with over 1k hours in game. Not to boast (in fact, admitting to having that many hours invested into ANY video game is nothing to be proud of), but I kind of feel like I’ve already “won” in the game by achieving that level, being properly equipped for any fight, and have more caps and 3*** Legendaries than I know what to do with. 

But I digress....I wanted to share what I have been using them membership for thus far. 

I enter a “Private World”. I launch a nuke over Whitesprings. I kill all ghouls without having to be butt buddies with everyone else that normally floods Nuke zones. I legendary farm. While doing so, I reach out to a Level 27 that posted that he was looking for some help/guidance. He invites his similarly leveled friend and we all enter a private world. I launch a nuke, and kill maybe 5 ghouls total. The rest, I assist in moving the hoard, and letting the n00bs get the full kills. I don’t half way kill them, as they will never learn if you do the job for them. I just get the ghouls to spawn and get them riled up, then jump to a place of safety so the n00bs can XP farm and even pickup a legendary or 2. 

One of the n00bs died about 10+ times, but he didn’t give up. I was a little proud. 

When I was level 30, a Level 200 took me under his wing and showed me how to camp build without looking like an idiot with Lincoln Logs. He told me to “Pay it forward” when I was high level. That’s exactly what I’m doing and told the n00b the same thing. 

The FO1st Private Servers are certainly flawed, but they still are great platforms for teaching, quietly camp building, farming, and anything else your heart desires without the large lobby barrage that can often occur in full servers. 

And on a final note, the Robotic dance emote is fucking hilarious. That alone is worth a hundred bucks. 

Don’t agree? Don’t care. I like the stupid subscription thing. So sue me.",0.52,0.0,105.0,-0.45,0.45,2275.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Addressing The Comment Removal,18,JusticeServed,169,"This has been fixed and we are working to reverse the removed comments. Originally this was done to prevent the increasing number of racist/homophobic comments that were getting around the flagging system, mostly from users brigading from certain subreddits that have recently been quarantined. However an error in the automoderator configuration set the number of reports far too low, and as a result this was exploited.          

The previous system is back in place, and users can no longer remove comments by reporting them once, although comments that receive enough reports will be automatically removed as they were previously.               

All that said - we are a large subreddit and are obligated to stay advertiser friendly, and we are also obligated to remove certain content that is not advertiser friendly or may result in negative media. At least if we don't want to be quarantined.

[NO SPOILERS] FUNDRAISING FOR EMILIA CLARKE'S SAMEYOU CHARITY,0,gameofthrones,1163,"
The *SameYou* charity was created with Emilia Clarke, who suffered through 2 brain aneurysms during the filming of *Game of Thrones*, to increase rehabilitation services after brain injury and stroke for young adults. Here is the link to the charity:

https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/justicefordaenerys

This particular donation drive was started in r/freefolk and r/asoiaf by **u/Elle_Ellaria** in order to thank Emilia for her excellent performance and hard work. It has met with incredible success and received a special thankyou video from Emilia herself: 

https://streamable.com/u6ggd

I cannot find any words to better describe it than those of the original creator :

*On March 21st 2019, weeks before the final season of Game of Thrones was set to air, Emilia Clarke penned a personal essay for the New Yorker. [ link here: tiny.cc/emilia ] In it, she opened up about the serious health struggles she experienced in the early stages of filming for the show, and how she fought through pain, fear and exhaustion to give her all to each performance. Her revelation came as a huge shock; to know that in season 2, while Daenerys was leading her khalasar across the bleak Red Waste and fiercely fighting for her life at the gates of Qarth, Emilia was similarly fighting for hers.*

*She speaks often of the inspiration and source of strength that Dany has been for her over the past ten years, and she is not alone. Emilia’s incredible Emmy-worthy acting and dedication to her character has inspired thousands and, as each season passed, we fell more and more in love with Dany. We rooted for her through trauma and hardship. We watched her triumph over her enemies and struggle with responsibility of rule. We saw her grapple between the urge for revenge, and the need for justice. And even at the very end, when things took a tragic turn for Daenerys Stormborn, Emilia still made us feel pity for the little girl who only ever wanted to return to her home.*

*This fundraiser began in r/freefolk, the same subreddit the now-infamous petition originated from. Since the tongue-in-cheek nature of that petition has flown over a lot of peoples' heads, to the point that it's prompted backlash from some of the cast, we wanted to show that Game of Thrones fans appreciate the hard work of the incredible cast & crew despite their constraints. Any disappointment we felt with the conclusion of the series was not in them, but rather in the potential that was lost due to the rushed pace of storytelling.* 

*And so, as a gesture of love and support from the fandom to the entire cast & crew - but also particularly to the woman who poured her very soul into her character, who delivered passionate speeches in High Valyrian and Dothraki in between questioning her very mortality, and inspired so many of us with her resilience -  I am setting up this page as a public support of her charity, SameYou. *

*ThankYouEmilia for bringing Daenerys to life. Thank you Lena, Nikolaj, Peter, Gwendoline, Jacob, Nathalie, Alfie, Kit, Sophie, Maisie, Isaac, Liam, Iain, Conleth, Kristofer, Pilou, Rory and the rest of the cast. Thank you to all the crew, the special effects departments and set designers, costume designers and casting, musicians and technicians, the camera crew, the stunt co-ordinators, the long list of people who've devoted themselves to giving everything they could to lift this juggernaut of a series to its lofty levels of success and attention. You all deserve to be recognised. Thank you.*

So instead they pinned my new post about the charity (biggest one so far)... go figure. Anyway, it is what it is. Maybe it will help raise awareness of the charity that little bit more, and mend some of that rift between subs. Or maybe not. It's up to the community.",0.43,0.0,61.0,0.0,0.0,5146.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

New here...but being called transphobic by my kid who thinks he’s a girl,96,GenderCritical,215,"This is driving me crazy AND breaking my heart. He started talking about wanting to transition about two years ago (he’s 17 now) and I was shocked — nothing ever in his life had made me think he was unhappy with who he was. So I questioned him. I asked him why it mattered what gender he thought he was because a guy can be feminine and like feminine things, and that it seemed profoundly reductive to me. Be whoever you want to be, but why do you need to change your gender? I have been a hard-core feminist since I was a kid. I believe that there can be a spectrum of behaviors for either sex, and the idea that ALL these kids are suddenly trans...it felt like a cult to me. Or like...trendy. But this isn’t like black nail polish or begging for a jean jacket. This is some permanent shit, and I honestly couldn’t process how suddenly there are hard-and-fast gender “roles,” apparently...and every kid who feels moderately uncomfortable during puberty or “hates their body” should obviously IMMEDIATELY be started on hormones, or you’re a transphobe. 

I’m not a transphobe. I am a mother and a feminist and I think way too much of this trans stuff is a big mind-fuck for these kids — they’re getting these messages that transitioning will magically make all their problems go away. And I said no. 

I said no, and in that moment, I became a villain. I found his mastodon account (because of course mastodon) and reading what he wrote about me? It was like the Twilight Zone. We took his computer away. We only let him have his phone when he was going out. We tried to spend more time with him. We took him to therapists (yes, three to be exact) and he hated them. We changed his medication to try to help with his anxiety and depression. But nothing is budging him. 

Last night, everything exploded. Let me first say that we live in a healthy home, emotionally. But any pushback or criticism makes me a monster. 

When he was like 12, he latched onto the GamerGate stuff. I talked him down from that eventually. But to go from GamerGate to “I’m a girl” in the space of three or so years? No, I think we need to continue addressing his mental health needs. 

Anyway, last night he and I had a fight (because he is basically living on our couch when he HAS a perfectly good bedroom, and he basically has taken over our one common living space). I told him he didn’t get to decide when our master bedroom door was open and shut — if we were too loud, he could GO. TO. HIS. ROOM. 

He started screaming at me, and I had to just get out of the house for a while. Apparently while I was gone, he told his father that he was going to live with a friend in Boston and get a job there, etc etc. So we asked him how he’d get there, and he said his friend offered to pay for it. We pointed out he hasn’t shown any initiative as far as getting a driver’s license, *and he lost his permit AND his passport was expired. He didn’t really have a response, but he talked about how he was going to get a tech job in Boston (apparently without a high school degree or a resume, because he could prove in an interview that he had skills). We explained to him that’s not how job-searching works. And we have no idea who this “friend” in Boston is. He won’t give us details, except that this friend will call him “Zoe” and let him live his gender identity. 

I am at a loss. We don’t want him to end up homeless or abused or killed. 

I’ve been actively looking for medications or therapies that might turn the tide. He is also spectrum-ish and studies show kids on the spectrum are way more likely to think they’re trans. But of course, there’s no recent information on what might help because now the only acceptable way to “help” is to start hormones, etc.

As I was desperately looking for answers again today, I found this sub. I’m at a total loss. I need guidance on things that have helped others “transition” out of this mindset. I am unwilling to let him mutilate his body, but I can’t get him out of this rut where he lives in an alternate reality, thinks he’s emotionally abused (I promise you he is not — the sum total of our abuse is just not supporting a transition), and has cast me as some sort of movie monster whose only purpose in life is to destroy him. 

I’m not a monster, and he KNOWS that. He just wants people to keep telling him he’s a girl and we’re the worst. 

Does anyone have advice for steps we can take to just get him back to a half-decent place? I feel like my heart is being ripped out and I don’t have any idea how to pull it back in. 

EDITED TO ADD: There is hardly ever yelling in our house, but I feel like a whole lot is being made of he & I fighting. He GETS hugs. He GETS live. He GETS praise for good work. We are loving parents who hold our kids and hug them big.I take meds that make me dizzy at night. When he sees me kind of wobbling toward the kitchen for water, he gently puts his arm around my back and lays me back down and brings me a drink. Two days this week I asked the kids to pick a number between 1-50 and both times he got it. EXACTLY right. We think so much alike. 

And he’s a genius. Literally. Like 155+. That makes it hard enough to fit in as it is. But please don’t take away some characterization of our household being adversarial. It’s not. It’s a peaceful, living home where we worn through thing. We just haven’t figured out the path through yet, though I’m certain it’s not endocrine disruption at 17.

Just played my first game of Dota and it was awesome!,9,DotA2,47," 

Hey guys!

So, I am an awful MOBA player. The only MOBAs I played were DOTA on Warcraft 3 and Smite with my buds on Xbox. Both of them, I was trash at. I just couldn't learn them.

However, I recently built a PC. First time in over a decade. So, I downloaded DOTA 2, because I wanted to learn and get better. So, after 3 weeks of absolutely sucking, I decided to watch pros play Shadow Fiend (my favorite hero so far, followed by chaos knight) on YouTube. After hours of reading and watching, I started picking up on the nuances of last hits and even denials. I started noticing the roles of Mid, off, and safe lanes. Still learning when to jungle, though.

Once I started getting a feel for the very fine clicks I needed to be, well, clicking, I jumped into a match. If I recall correctly, this match was close to an hour long, and it was my first match where I jumped in as SF, mid lane by myself.

Woo! Was that fun! I actually was the fastest to level up and get gold! I saw OTHER players run away from me! I felt so powerful! I learned to not over-push with SF and not get greedy. I actually used my items instead of them sitting there for passive stats. We won! Handily! And the other team wasn't even comprised of newbs worse than I!

What makes this feel even better, is that some of these skills transferred to other heroes I haven't played, such as CK. I loved his style! Played safe lane, and we won that too!

I know these victories don't matter much to people here who are obviously seasoned, but it just feels so good to not be carried, to contribute effevtively and to start my ascent of the learning curve!

Edit: Holy hell guys, thanks for the warm welcome! I thought this would be swept under the rug!

A guide to leveling from 1 to 72 in an efficient way.,3,Borderlands,50,"So basically I have been playing borderlands 2 since its realase on ps3 and I have gotten every character to OP 8 at least once. Basically I was wondering if anyone would want me to make a guide to leveling up and playing through the game in a very fast way. It takes me around 24-30ish hours to get from 1-72 and about another 6-8 hours to get to OP 8 from there. I know little tricks about leveling and can explain what guns/parts and prefixes you want while playing through the game with each character. TBH I am about to have a lot of free time on my hands and want to do something with it. You feel me? Anyway let me know if you want to see a guide.

[D] Doing a PhD is not worth it unless exception circumstances exist,4,MachineLearning,198,"This is a throwaway account since I don't wish to reveal my affiliation.

I am currently a PhD student at one of the top 10 groups in ML in the USA and am loving my studies and really wouldn't want to be doing anything else at this current moment. Given this, it’s an extremely specific set of circumstances that led me to do a PhD. To be blunt, outside of top tier programs, I don’t see any benefits of doing a PhD. I have interned at a top company and every single employee I worked with had come from the same set of about 50 labs, with many publications in the same top 3 conferences. I have realized that there is a very small set of (extremely) high paying research jobs for a very small selected amount of outstanding PhD graduates. Publications in theoretical ML are also dominated by a very small amount of universities and groups and if you are not in one of these groups you are unlikely to ever come close to these conferences.

If you are offered a PhD in a group that does not have consistent excellence in the top tier ML conferences, you do not have a shot at these research scientist roles (where we hear about the 300k+ salaries in ML). Everyone else I have seen has ended up in very traditional data scientist roles that could have been easily gained out of a masters or undergraduate degree. These roles do not require the research skills that we spend 4-7 years learning during a PhD and these research skills could even be a detriment to most commercial applied ML roles (since most of them are engineering oriented). Work experience is also extremely valuable in these roles and can present opportunities for raises that double your salary in the equivalent time to complete a PhD.

&#x200B;

I hear a lot of ""I have a PhD/MSc in a related field"" on this forum, but these credentials do not honestly carry any weight in getting the top tier research jobs that the media likes to discuss.  Do a PhD because you would love to make major theoretical contributions and have a supervisor that has the ability and track record to guide you to those contributions.  If the right formula exists, the money will come also.

&#x200B;

As a side note, concerning PhD admission, I also hear here that publications are not essential.  In the current year, almost every admitted student had a top tier first-author conference publication during undergraduate studies.  It is absolutely essential without interning at your target lab for 1+ years before applying.",0.51,0.0,68.0,-0.15,0.1,2471.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Blizzard is seriously underestimating Classic.,81,classicwow,668,"*""I could easily see the outcome being people logging in, going 'Wow, the game is so much better now,' and logging out,"" explained Blizzard community manager Josh ""Lore"" Allen when asked about vanilla servers.""*



https://www.usgamer.net/articles/blizzard-vs-nostalrius-the-case-for-a-legacy-world-of-warcraft-server



You know, it's reasons like this that make me question decisions such as layering.




Are they seriously underestimating Vanilla's potential? The legendary MMORPG that shook the gaming industry?




Do their ""analysts"" expect people to mass quit after Phase 1 when Vanilla itself had extremely high retention and Vanilla private servers have been going very strong for more than a decade now? Do they honestly think most of Classic's audience are after a nostalgia fix? 


Or is it that they are envious of the OG devs? They can't admit they've taken a legendary franchise and ruined it so bad to a point it's just a mere shadow of what it used to be, milking it with micro transactions for all its worth?




Kevin Jordan is one of the three original game designers for WoW, and here is what he has to say to modern Blizzard:



""You don't sound like a game designer Ion, you sound like a computer.""



https://youtu.be/JwojRc4ZAOM?t=2087









Release is next month. 




Why do we not have a stand alone Classic website with the OG Forums yet?



Why did they have a shitton of BFA advertisements/commercials and we have none for Classic?



We need more communication regarding sharding, layering, incorrect animations, hunter pet pathing, and the many issues we've observed in the beta.

Why Derrick Rose is the most overrated player of this Decade,10,nba,142,"Derrick Rose is famous for being the youngest MVP ever. Rose is also infamous for being extremely injury prone. 

Due to Rose's injuries he has gained lots of sympathy over the years. Most of it is deserved, he was an MVP level player whose career got ruined by injuries. 

Rose has always had a large fan base over the years, and because of his injury history, no one really talked negatively about him. (besides injury jokes) 

I have always believed Rose to be overrated, and for little good reason it has always made me annoyed and angry when people talk about him like he was going to be Michael Jordan if he didn't get injured. 

I have kept my stance to myself over the years, since there is no real need for me to bash on a player who hasn't been relevant or healthy for years. 

But this All-Star voting result has pushed me over the edge. 

I get it. It's a popularity contest. Dwayne Wade is #2 in the East, and Kobe Bryant was an all-star starter in a year he was awful. And Rose has been having a comeback season and it is impressive he is playing at a high level after what seemed like the end of his career. 

But I'm here to tell you that it's all good ole nostalgia that is blinding you from the fact that Rose wasn't as good as everyone makes him out to be. 

Let's look at Rose's MVP season, his stats were;
25 PPG, 7.7 APG, 4.1 RPG, 1 SPG, 0.6 BPG, 13.1 Win Shares. 

Since Rose's MVP season in 2010-2011, (last 8 years in the NBA, not including this year), there have been 18 other instances of players averaging a stat line of;
23+ PPG, 5+ APG, 4+ RPG, 13 Win Shares

Those players are;
Lebron (6), Harden (4), Curry (3), Durant (2), Westbrook (2), Butler (1) 

Out of those 19 instances (18 + Rose's MVP season), here are Rose's ranks in each of the following categories;

PPG: 15th
RPG: 19th
APG: Tied 7th 
Win Shares: Tied 18th
SPG: Tied 18th
BPG: Tied 8th
TPG: Tied 6th 
FG%: 15th
3P%: 16th
FT%: Tied 9th
TS%: 19th
PER: 19th
ORTG: 18th
DRTG: Tied 5th 
USG%: 7th 


My point is, Derrick Rose had one great year, which when compared to other MVP caliber players the past decade, wasn't even that great. 

I understand that he was young and had potential to get better, but he is put on a pedestal by some people that he doesn't deserve. 

Jimmy Butler's 2016-2017 year with the Bulls;
23.9 PPG, 5.5 APG, 6.2 RPG 1.9 SPG, 0.4 BPG, 13.8 Win Shares 
Is extremely similar to Rose's MVP season, and I would expect nothing but laughter if I were to ever compare the two in their prime. 

All stats according to Basketball Reference.

Viewers directly translate to money. It’s my opinion that way too many people are prioritizing view count/sub count over Role Play.

If you let your chat/paycheck direct your RP, you are no longer RPing. You are pandering to your communities wants over the RP community’s NEEDS. 

This is, in my opinion the biggest issue this community currently faces, and it’s only getting worse with time.

I’ve seen too many AMAZING characters/RPers go this route. The fact is it’s EASIER to simply hop on and hype up your chat with shootouts/chases rather than actually sit down and create memorable and unique role play.

There is a time and place for “Silly” and “shitlord” type Role Play, but you should always remain mindful of your personal impact to the overall RP community.

If there isn’t an end scenario for your current conflict that involves you losing on the table, then you are Powergaming, and should re-assess your current Role Play.

There is nothing wrong with having a character around for years. There is absolutely a problem when you start using your characters OOC immortality to your advantage in game to get what you want

-----

**Regarding Rules**

It’s unacceptable that most new people to the RP community are being more mindful and respectful of our rules/guidelines than veterans of the community.

The OG’s should be the ones leading by example, and instead any new player is likely to be met with multiple rule breaks and be used up as a prop and disposed of.

[RULES](https://www.nopixel.net/upload/index.php?threads/nopixel-official-rules-guidelines.104748/)

READ THESE RULES! No seriously, actually click the link and read the rules on that page.
Here are few I’d like to specifically direct your attention too.

**Powergaming:** 
•	Sprinting/Fighting as soon as you leave the hospital, or are revived by medics
•	Talking/Organizing while downed.

**Random Death Match(RDM):**
•	Attacking another player/group without any story/roleplay leading up to it.

You cannot honestly say you are giving quality Role Play if you return within the hour at 100% health/ability to get revenge after having lost a conflict. You are trying to re-roll the dice in your favor when you’ve already lost. Have a plan B, have a character B, but do not take your “loss” out on your fellow roleplayers.


“Story/RP leading up to it” means the OTHER person you are attacking should have a good understanding of why they are being attacked.

Think about this. Your character is ACTIVELY MURDERING SOMEONE. If you don’t have a VERY good reason as to why… again, you need to re-asses your Role Play.

-----

**Regarding “fear of reporting”**

This is absolute bullshit. If you have an issue with someone in the community, reach out and communicate like an adult. Letting your chat communicate for you is a downright lazy/toxic way to try and get your point across

If you don’t feel like you can’t have a civil discussion, that’s what the mods/staff/admins/trust is there for.

I have not ONE SINGLE time been reached out to regarding my RP or in character actions. My door is, and has always been open for discussion.

-----

I may be completely wrong regarding all of this, and I’m fully willing to admit if that is the case

I feel that we as a community should be building each other up and supporting one another, rather than fighting over views/subs

I know it’s nice to have that record sub/view count now, but I can assure you, if we keep heading the way we are now we will ALL lose out in the end. After all, rising tides raise all ships

It’s my genuine hope that I am not alone in these thoughts, and that other members of the community will step up and voice their opinion. If I am way off target here, and the MAJORITY of people INSIDE the RP community feel different, then I will gladly step down from the trust and keep my mouth shut. 

My goal has always been to help make this community, IN IT’S ENTIRETY, a better place. 

We can do better, we should do better, and if we don’t we are all heading for a big crash… and sooner than you think.

&#x200B;

Providing Combat Record on mobile and web brings the stats that players want to the platform where they will get the most use out of them without taking time away from playing the game, so you can check your stats quickly and easily on your phone, tablet, or PC between matches. This new Combat Record is an on-the-go solution that we hope our stats-loving fans will enjoy, and we'd like to thank our partners at Activision for helping to make this a reality.

# Showcasing Player Stats in Black Ops 4

When we originally launched Combat Record with *Call of Duty: Black Ops*, we were excited by the potential of going deep on player stats, and we expanded the feature set throughout the *Black Ops* series. It was a big feature that unfortunately only a small number of players engaged with in the game because it was buried deep in the menus, and our design goal with *Black Ops 4* has been to bring the most meaningful statistics to more players in more locations where they will see and interact with them.

For example:

* **Multiplayer:** In the Stats synopsis at the top level of the Barracks, Multiplayer and World League stats highlight the most interesting stats around gameplay performance that are easy to digest with one button press. Additionally, your personal stats for every map and mode are displayed on the loading screens of each match you play. Specialist performance stats are included in the Specialist Personalization menus so players see them every time they customize their characters.
* **Zombies:** Stats in Zombies have been expanded to include new stats for Classic, Rush, and Gauntlets, along with the Black Ops Authenticity Stamp system to provide a ton of new data for every match played.
* **Blackout:** In Blackout, top stats can be filtered by mode or averaged across all modes, including hot drop kills, longest distance kills, kills per game, headshot percentages, distance traveled, vehicles destroyed, revives and clean-ups per game, average damage, and more. And we recently added the ability to track Blackout stats in limited-time modes separately from the core Quads, Duos and Solo playlists.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tdzk0smu0aq21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e15dfc2f5472466a9bb59d02720b3be3c0679134

&#x200B;

Likewise with Leaderboards, with millions of players racking up an endless stream of stats across Multiplayer, Blackout, Zombies, and League Play, we took a new approach to making Leaderboard stats more meaningful to players who want to know how they stack up against their peers. In the game at launch, we expanded the functionality of Leaderboards to introduce customization options that allow players to add and remove other players to their Leaderboards via the “Players List” button in the Leaderboards menu, in addition to instantly tracking progress against friends. These customization options apply to Leaderboards in every standard game type in Multiplayer (Core and Hardcore), in Zombies, across the various game modes in Blackout, and also now in the World League Hub in a dedicated Competitive Leaderboard.

&#x200B;

One last item worth covering: early on, we made a mistake when we said “Combat Record” would be coming shortly after launch when describing the launch of additional stats coming to the game the following week. That was a miscommunication on our part, and that’s on us. For that, we apologize sincerely to the community.

Thanks as always for your continued support, and keep an eye out for even more content coming to *Black Ops 4* throughout the month of April and beyond. Learn more about *Black Ops 4*’s new mobile Combat Record and the Call of Duty app’s newest features [here](https://blog.activision.com/call-of-duty/2019-04/Gain-Combat-Record-Control-with-Todays-Call-of-Duty-Companion-App-Update), and download the app today for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call-of-duty-companion-app/id1405837628?ls=1&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.callofduty.companion). You can also access the web version of Combat Record by logging into [CallOfDuty.com](https://my.callofduty.com/player/combatrecord).

# Barebones Healing Update

As some of you may have noticed in-game, we've recently reduced the time it takes for your manual heal to recharge and be ready to use in Barebones from 7.3 seconds down to 5 seconds. This change was made with the community in mind, as we’ve heard several requests to allow for faster healing now that Stim Shot is restricted along with all other Gear in Barebones. Jump into a match, see how the new healing cooldown speed feels in-game, and let us know what you think.

# New Developer Video Update

In case you missed it, our new Developer Update video is now live with intel from the dev team on our newest content and features in all modes, as well as details on what’s on the horizon in *Black Ops 4*, including **Infected** and **Deathmatch Domination** in MP, our upcoming new-and-improved **Ambush LTM** in Blackout, and more. [Check out the full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6qlUNQSRBw).

Important: We have updated our relevance rule!,6,leagueoflegends,1,"Hi Everyone,

Over the last year or two, we've received a lot of [feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/9vn4d2/relevance_the_final_frontier_lets_bridge_it/) about our relevance rule. Many people found the line around what is and isn't allowed rather blurry, and our moderation has been inconsistent due to the gray area inherent in the rule. 

We've spent the last few months discussing the scope of the subreddit and working to better define our relevance rule so that users and mods alike have clarity regarding our enforcement. So without further ado, here is our updated relevance rule:

#Must be directly related to League of Legends

> Posts must **focus on and be directly** related to League of Legends: the game, the league community (fanart, cosplay, fanfiction, etc), and league esports. For posts related to personalities and esports, the content must focus on players/orgs interactions with the game and not their lives outside of it.

> [Here is a link to examples of allowed content under this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/wiki/relevance_rule) This is not an exhaustive list.

> All submissions about this subreddit's moderation, policies, and features (""Meta"" posts) are not allowed. Such topics should be submitted to /r/leagueofmeta.

&nbsp;

**Explanation of changes**

1) We expect content to be focused on and directly related to League of Legends, which encompasses three main buckets: The game, the community, and league esports.

We included the words ""focused on,"" as the mod team looks at the focus of a post when determining if something is directly related to League. If you submit a post that shows a massive mural of League of Legends on a building in NYC and focus the post on the fact that the spray paint used is eco-friendly, then it will be removed because you are focusing on that element instead of the League of Legends element.

2) When considering whether or not something is ""directly related"", you should first ask yourself: Is this related enough to League of Legends? If your answer is no, then it shouldn't be posted here. If you aren't sure, send us a modmail and ask.

3) We have kept the rest of the rule more or less intact. We still disallow posts about league personalities doing non-league related things, however we have reworded it to provide more clarity.

**Explanation of changes**

We found that esports had the most scope creep over the last several years. It's a booming industry that has exploded, and as it's gained in popularity, we've had an increasingly difficult time defining what is and is not relevant under our rules. 

While it might look like there are a lot of changes, the subreddit should feel very much like it does now. Many of the things now listed as explicitly not allowed were already being removed under our old relevance rule, albeit inconsistently. The primary issue we sought to resolve here was to stop inconsistent enforcement in favor of very clear guidelines that users and mods alike could understand.

-----

That's all for now. Please share your feedback. We'll monitor the updated relevance rule and continue to look for ways to improve it. ",0.5,0.0,46.0,0.5,1.0,5638.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"[socjus] Streamer Hbomberguy Raises Over $230,000 for Trans Charity to spite Graham Linehan",42,KotakuInAction,844,"http://archive.is/2xswK

A trans charity was supposed to get a bunch of money from the national lottery in the UK. This was successfully blocked by a campaign led by former IT Crowd and Father Ted writer (as well as occasional KiA punching bag, feel free to search the sub) Graham Linehan. This led Leftist youtuber Hbomberguy to announce a Donkey Kong 64 100 percent charity stream. It’s blowing up and people like Cher and Neil Gaiman have donated.

He’s over 50 hours in, and is breaking down. It’s a fun watch.

Buying Fallout First But For the Right Reasons?,9,fo76,163,"This may or may not get annihilated into oblivion but I feel the need to say this. 

There is all the hate going on right nowsaying like we have been lied to by Bethesda, that buying First is going to destroy the industry, etc. We’ve all heard it. 

Well before this announcement I was already casually throwing about $10 into the game once a month give or take. What if instead of paying for 76 because I’m a trash person that proves that Bethesda is evil, I wanted to pay ~$8 a month for $15 worth of Atoms, and coincidentally also got infinite scrap space, my favorite outfit in all of Fallout history, a second fast travel location, and servers that I could just play with my friends and didn’t have to deal with level 30’s tagging the Scorchbeast queen only to contribute nothing to her scaling difficulty?

What if I already enjoyed playing 76 all this time because it itches all the right scratches for me and supporting them with a relatively low monthly fee (I can’t even say I don’t spend more monthly on a gym membership I barely touch...)  so that the video game company running this game can KEEP THE LIGHTS ON for all the people screaming that back in the day you only paid for a game once but that refuse to pay again (that’s fine you don’t have to) but want eternal content updates for free. 

At the end of the day, people like being paid wages for the work they do and Bethesda does this crazy program where they need to pay their employees these wages for the work they do. If they don’t find ways to minimally harm the actual game while monetizing certain things that, realistically, cost them more money to develop, then the company can’t keep funding the developers and instead of having private servers that don’t affect the current game in literally any way that everyone still gets to use, we will have NO game to play, free or not. 

TL;DR
Don’t fault players that enjoy 76 for supporting the developers by buying First because we’re keeping the lights on for all the people that don’t pay.

The Blunt Truth About How A Guild Fills an MC Raid,5,classicwow,417,"I posted this in another thread, and it got a positive response, with people saying it should have its own thread to discuss.


I raided in Vanilla and BC, and I haven't played WoW for more than a decade until Classic came out. Now I'm an officer in a raiding guild that has MC on farm. We use a loot counsel.

Week after week, what I encounter from many players is a mentality that the guild exists for the sole purpose of taking them into MC and personally handing them all the loot. These players essentially view it as a group finder for MC. They seem to have no interest in the guild as a community. They never help anyone out or run dungeons with other people in the guild, they never log into discord except during the raid, and they don't spend any time talking with anyone or making friends.  I don't know if this is a retail mentality thing or not, but I don't remember much of this attitude back in the day.


At raid time, we have 45-50 level 60s logged in and ready to raid. The 30 or so core community guys that are on most days and show up most weeks start get invited to the raid. Word gets out that the raid is forming up and the people who are unsure whether or not they will get in get it start desperately flooding guild chat with ""inv"" while the officers figure out how to fill the remaining 10 or so slots.

Six or seven of the remaining slots are filled based upon raid composition need and requests by the class officers to take particular people they have been talking with that week and want to give a tryout. Finally, we're down to the three or four final slots, and we have eight or nine people to choose from. Guild chat is still being spammed with ""INVITE!!1!"" - this is super annoying and has zero effect on whether you will be invited (It actually makes us want to invite you less). None of the officers seem to know anything about these remaining people other than the fact that they joined some time in the past two weeks and have never made sort of personal connection with anyone in the guild - especially not their class officer - the actual person who can get them in the raid. Sadly, most are rogues, hunters, or pure dps warriors. We usually choose the people who have been least whiny and annoying.

Immediately after the raid fills, 2 or 3 of the people who didn't make the raid quit the guild. Nobody gives a shit about these people and we're glad to see them gone.

During the raid, we are very hesitant to give gear to these ""filler"" players because we have no confidence in them or their commitment to the guild. We think it's just as likely that, if they didn't get lucky and grab one of the final raid slots, they would have quit the guild as well.

TL;DR: The way to get into the raid and to get loot is to **communicate with your guild leadership (especially your class officer) and demonstrate that you're a team player.** If we know who you are and think you're a team player, we want to give you loot - often before ourselves. If we don't know who you are, we don't want to give you loot, because we think you're treating the guild as your personal loot pinata.",0.51,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,3114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The mechanics behind the implicit mods explained,0,pathofexile,104,"Some people rush 100, others tries to get a lot of currency, but I spent my time researching the new mechanics instead.

Basicly the implicit modifier you get is taken from the pool of mods from the three items you merge.

Item level of the final item is taken from the highest ilvl item of the three.

Different mods have different chance of becoming the implicit based on where you put the item due to different weightings.

Left slot:
Memorized prefix 400
Prefix 200
Crafted prefix 100
Memorized suffix 100
Suffix 50
Crafted suffix 25

Middle slot:
Memorized pre/suffix 200
Pre/suffix 100
Crafted pre/suffix 50

Right slot:
Memorized prefix 100
Prefix 50
Crafted prefix 25
Memorized suffix 400
Suffix 200
Crafted suffix 100

Once the mod has been selected it will then convert it to an implicit mod of similar type. Movement speed mod will give movement speed implicit, +mana gives flat or %mana, +gem levels with X gives quality of gems with X etc.

You can manipulate the outcome by some methods, the item that gives the final item its ilvl can't give any of its mods. The same goes for the item that gives the base.

If you have three items with the same item level then it will take the ilvl from the middle item and thus eliminating mods from its pool.

Once ilvl has been taken then the base of the item goes next, the base chosen can't give the final item mods from its pool.

The remaining item will be the one that gives one mod to the implicit of final item.

If you have the highest ilvl in middle (or all three same ilvl) and then same base of left and right item, then it will take one mod from the left item _and_ one mod from the right item and thus granting the final item two implicits.

For years, gun safety advocates and lawmakers have sought to solve the nation’s gun crisis by asking for politically palpable incremental reforms like background checks or closing the terrorist loophole. Such a strategy appeals to risk-averse politicians worried about alienating moderate voters. But, it has fallen short of channeling widespread public support for gun safety policies into real change. In 2016, I founded an organization with a bold vision for a new movement dedicated to building a future with fewer guns. My book, Guns Down: How To Defeat The NRA And Build A Safer Future With Fewer Guns, provides a roadmap for saving countless lives by raising the standard for gun ownership in America and making guns significantly harder to get.

"Can we PLEASE stop complaining about how ""sweaty"" PvP is",333,DestinyTheGame,736,"I see it every day on this sub and hear it every day in the Discord I'm a part of.  

""I played quickplay/competitve/gambit and a four-stack was using Luna's Howl/Spectral Blades/Izanagi's Burden and it's bullsh*t, they're so sweaty/such tryhards, why is this game like this.""

- Every PvP game is like this. 
- You're supposed to try hard.
- Everyone wants to win, and will do whatever they can to make that happen.
- People that like winning will team up with other people that like winning to increase their chances of winning. 

Have you ever heard LeBron say after losing to the Warriors in the Finals that, ""they were trying too hard?"" No, because that's a goddamn ridiculous thing to say. Now, are the Warriors a ridiculous superteam that probably shouldn't exist? Yes, but the NBA is unbalanced right now, just like Destiny. And the only time Destiny was actually balanced, it was straight-up boring. (Plus LeBron took advantage of that imbalance himself in Miami.)

Just stop, please. Complain about imbalance all you want, because that's something that can be fixed. But stop blaming ""tryhards."" Human beings are competitive. Get over it.

First Major Update FAIL...,65,thedivision,204,"First congratulations on a great game and probably the best Live Game launch I have witnessed...
With that out of the way let's address the BAD...

1-No Specialization ammo dropping....(3 bullets in 2 hours)

2-NPC's stuck in T- Pauses. (Pretty much everywhere)

3-Skills builds still not worth it. (Number values are too low to consider a Skill build)

4-Weapon mods making some weapons useless. (AR having less ammo than my P-90)
Give us the option to use both types.Only positive effect and Positive and Negative. 

5-Running out of Ammo in Heroic missions  (800 AR mag not enough when two clips needed to down a red bar).We had this problem in D1 untill addressed. 

6-Gear sets no where near as good as Hi-End gear.

7-Chem Launcher change Not implemented well. (In a game with many enemies flanking and moving with lightning speed just not practical)

8-Hive activates on occasion. 

9-Not a problem from this update but on Challenging and Heroic being glued to cover gets you killed.(Simple Fix:Remove the Glue/magnetic mechanic)

10-Exotic LMG if it was meant to be a PvP weapon not really useful. 

11-DZ experience feels slower maybe I'm wrong.

There are more but those are major things Massive should look into.

THIS IS IN NO WAY CRITICIZING THE GAME JUST POINTING OUT THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TESTED WITH A PRIVATE SERVER BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION. 
This will save the developers the back and forth and let them work on other things.

"Probably controversial opinion: the handling, characterisation and writing of Slaanesh gave some people an out to behave like conservative puritans and bigots under the guise of irony and has made writing Slaanesh problematic and complicated.",0,40kLore,212,"Before i get into this i understand a caveat is in order here: **please try not to feel personally slighted or that i am painting with a broad brush here.** I am simply trying to iterate a specific sort of behaviour that i seein the fanbase. I am not trying to say you, the individual, are doing this or that everyone here is taking the blame. This is just something i think deserves to be mentioned and dissected out loud.

____

It shouldn't be controversial to say that Slaanesh has... issues, with the way they were portrayed. From their earliest inception, Slaanesh and their accompanying cult took 'inspiration' (if i can call it that) from queer and especially, queer leather kink culture, in order to communicate for lack of a better word, unrestrained sexual perversion and twisted, evil decadence and vile excess. 

[It's quite well put in this essay here by queer writer Dorian Dawes, who describes the issues as such](https://medium.com/@RealDorianDawes/lets-talk-about-warhammer-40k-830b27686a6e)
______

> _Degeneracy is Slaanesh’s domain. A being of unfiltered sexuality, worshiped by succubi, queers, and kinksters. Androgyny and queer sexuality is lumped in with sadomasochism, rape, and sexual abuse._

> _Stories regarding Slaanesh and her cult typically involve beautiful women seducing faithful Imperial guards or Space Marines into their beds making them vulnerable to demonic possession. Sometimes her cultists are portrayed as being androgynous, lithe young men “trapping” otherwise straight and masculine men into an act of queerness._

> ***It’s gay panic for space operas.***
____

You can disagree wheter or not the afforementioned scenarios happen as much as we think, but i think it's undeniable that, even if not in the lore but definatley within the fandom at large, that there's this certain unfortunate way that Slaanesh and their cult are portrayed.

You see it from the characterisation and depiction of Slaanesh as genderfluid and intersex, appearing at will in either male, feminine, androgyne or transgender forms, to the point where it's become a 'joke' in the fandom to draw Slaanesh with an obvious bulge. 

See for example, in TTS where Magnus wonderfully reffers to Slaanesh s 'he.... she.... it?'. Needless to say as a trans person i was uncomfortable with this, despite my love of TTS as a comedy show. It was the first sort of taste i got as a WH40k fan that the way fans envisioned queerness and transness was colored by a very specific meme and even bigotry that was masked and cloaked behind a veil of comedic irony. Comedic irony i myself engaged with as well, joking about with friends about wanting to bang a Keeper of Secrets. 

Moreover the connections were then made, within the fandom, to apply this sort of characterisation to anything outside of the heterosexual norm and binary, often under the guise of irony.

But i can tell you, as a trans and queer person, seeing some refer to 'traps' as 'heretical' and then follow that up by saying 'furries need to be purged' doesn't really come off as comedic ironic space xenophobia, when the targets are actual people who still suffer harm and societal demonisation for their percieved perversity and 'degeneracy', a word that has seen renewed popularity among certain segments of the population to use as a quick shorthand for everything not heterosexual or within the conventions of gender and gender expression.

It's then little wonder why these same sort of people will latch onto using this rhetoric at every turn to further ostracise people they already see as depraved. And that is the result of Slaanesh very deeply being queer-coded from the start.

**Associating transness and crossdressing with the God of Rape is deeply unsettling**, and it's something that i fear talking about lest i be seen as some sort of busybody who's rocking the boat too much. I really wish it wasn't this way but anytime someone mentions 'traps' in /r/Grimdank  i know which way the conversation is going to go. My body, my identity and my sex life, will be immediately connected to a malignant force of sexual violence and perversion. 


And i _have_ seen this sort of behaviour, just a few days ago i had someone told me that kinky sex in general was probably within the the realm of Slaanesh, which i think is an unfortunate demonisation of kink as a practice. One went even further to say that _anal sex in general_ would be seen as Slaaneshi excess.

See what i mean when i say that there's this certain framing that facilitated a noticeable culture of Puritansm cloaked in satire? 

The Imperium _is_ meant to be Puritanical, it is a heavily repressed society and culture that, with sudden kneejerks, reacts to anything slightly out of the ordinary as worthy of death, but for some people this nicely translated into bigotries and assumptions they might not eve be aware of, concealed beyond layers of irony that enables them to escape consequence or any deeper thought on it.

Certainly some people joking about this aren't really aware of the implications, but that's the form and functions of a society that subtly inculcates these things into people from a very young age

Slaanesh _shouldn't_ be associated with queerness, and not even kink for that matter because it's very honestly harmful, and _has_ been harmful. 

Every queer fan of WH40k that i personally know (and you'd be surprised at the ammount) feels it too. We obviously can't speak for everyone but it's a pervasive feeling at least among a decent number of people and i think that deserves consideration.

___

**Moreover it's made writing Slaanesh all the more difficult**, as it's become nigh impossible to untangle from the groundwork that's been laid, despite GW's best efforts to focus on Slaanesh as not being wholly around sex but merely hedonistic excess that can be applied to anything. Violence, artistic and musical ambition, pleasureable non-sexual excess (Noise Marines as an example) and drive, greed for wealth or power, and yes, sex and sexual violence as well.

I'm not personally completely opposed to having the sexual element be there, as sex is absolutely a vector of power and violence that people deal with and have dealt with, both in history and in our lives today. 

I believe good Slaanesh writing can be done without resorting to negative queercoding, or rather, i wish people would do more of it. 

Many serial killers were motivated by sexual desire, and the simple act of murder was sexually gratifying for many. People like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy Jr. 

As an example of something similar done right i think, look to *Hellraiser*, written by a kinky gay man. The horrifying element there wasn't neccesarily the 'queerness' of the cenobites, but the fact that to them, the division of pain and pleasure was entirely blurred, and it wasn't the act of kink or BDSM that was bad, but to seek it at the cost of other people and even yourself that brought the Cenobites to the human dimension.

I think you _can_ add sexual violence in an important and communicative way into the mix, but it desperately needs to be tempered with better treatment of queerness and kink, something deeply and problematically embedded into Slaanesh from the start.",0.49,0.0,242.0,0.025000000000000022,0.975,7259.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"My makeup Routine. I'm male, and new to this. All advice is welcome.",5,MakeupAddiction,71,"If this is against the rules, I apologise.

Personally, I feel like this is one of the biggest barriers men will face.

EDIT: I'm coping a bit of flak for how simplified this is. I wrote this for another subreddit directed at males. It got deleted because it didn't suit the rules, so I posted it here. I understand r/makeupaddiction is mostly populated by females who know what they're doing. But I found this subreddit when I was trying to figure out what to do, and thought other Males might too.


Why do I wear makeup?

> - I use it too highlight my eyes. I think they're a great part about me, and I can draw more attention to them.

> - To hide the bags under my eyes, this smoothes my face over and makes me look brighter and happier.

> - To even out my eyebrows.

> - Most importantly, because my wife does. Why should she put in all this work, Shaving her legs, looking after her skin, wearing makeup and picking outfits, for me to only shave my face once in a while. I too need to put in the effort. I also have a skincare routine, and keep my wardrobe up to date, and pluck my eyebrows, but these are different posts for different times.

So what makeup do I wear?

> I'm still new to this. I have been looking after my skin for 3 months now. On top of that, I've only been applying makeup since my wife bought me some products for Christmas.

> As there is still a strong stigma about men wearing makeup, I wanted to make sure it wasn't easy to tell. Luckily, my skin care meant I had a good complexion when I started, and my skin colour is easy to match.

> So I went looking for a simple, what's known as a ""Naked/Natural"" look. Which is minimal makeup, styled so it looks like you're not wearing any.

> Most of these require using a few products, Foundation, Concealer, a mineral finisher, and Eyeliner pen (Not pencil), Lip balm, and a Brow Pencil. Also an eyelash curler. I had some trouble with this though. It turns out, in the thick of summer, Mineral Powder on your face is damn itchy (Kudos to all those who manage. Men and Women alike). So I changed it around a bit. I only use Concealer, an Eyeliner Pen, Eyelash Curler, and a Brow Pencil (A brow pencil, unlike an Eyeliner pencil, has a spool on the end, which is a little brush used for smoothing your drawn on eyebrows (Don't worry, you won't look like a drag queen, you know, unless you want to, inwhich case I recommend gluing your eyebrows down and drawing them on higher). I don't use foundation because proper skincare has given me a complexion that I'm really proud of.

How do I apply my makeup?

> First things first, Clean your face, Moisturise, and then Brush your teeth (If you use foundation, then you won't rub it off when brushing your teeth, but it also gives a chance for the moisturiser to dry.)

> Next I apply concealer using a damp sponge. Wring it out under running water a couple of times to make sure it's completely wet, then give it a final squeeze into a towel to remove any excess water. The sponge should have increased in size. Next I apply the concealer under my eyes, I use a decent amount, but I dont apply it thickly. I then dab at it with the sponge to spread it out and make it even. 

> Next I do my eyebrows. I comb my eyebrows outward (Using the brush on the back of the Pencil), and then stroke the pen gently through my eyebrows. I'm looking for even coverage, so rather than using a single line, I fleck it through in the direction of my eyebrows. Remember, you can always add more (Adding too much you may need to start again, eyebrows are easily noticed. On this same point, it may look a little bit weird at first, but I feel awesome with strong eyebrows). As a final step, I brush my eyebrows a few times outwards. This is to spread the Pencil marks, so they don't look to harsh or defined. It blends it. The number one rule of all makeup (In my opinion) is to blend EVERYTHING.

> Lastly, I do my eyelashes. I don't use eyeliner, that's too noticeable, and I don't use Mascara, that's also noticeable. First thing I do is Curl my eyelashes, this gives them length, and makes the next step easier. Next I get my Eyeliner Pen, essentially it has a 1cm long felt tip. The I run this over the tips of my eyelashes (This will make you want to blink to begin with, after a month, however, I have no problem with it) to colour them black. Essentially I am colouring my eyelashes it, running the pen left to right, and then back again a few times, through my eyelashes. This leaves no gunky residue like mascara, and isn't as obvious as a strong line like traditional eyeliner. We're using out eyelashes to frame out eyes, not our eyelids. 

What do I need to do before I start using makeup?

> - Get supplies. If you are in a relationship with someone who uses makeup, you can practise with theirs. However, its likely thay their concealer and brow pen dont match. Eyeliner will be fine though, given theyre generally black, but you do need a pen with a felt brush, not a pencil.

> - Talk to your significant other. You're not the only one who has been brought up in a world where men can't wear makeup. Your partner may be uncomfortable at the thought of it, and you need to respect that and help them overcome this barrier aswell. They may even find it highly unappealing, preferring someone who doesn't wear make up. That is also okay. It may put strain on your relationship no matter what you do, or they may slowly warm to it. But if this is something you want to do, or discuss doing, you should let them know. Don't spend your life hiding a part of who you are because you were scared to open up to your significant other. I opened up to my wife. It was hard, while it is nothing near like coming out, it kinda felt like I was (I understand, 100% that I will never know the trauma of coming out, and I'm glad it is nothing I have ever had and ever will have to go through. If you have a problem with me using this statement, please PM me and I will edit it out of my explanation).

> - You need to understand that wearing makeup isn't gay. It's about as gay as eating tomato, plenty do and plenty don't. Wearing makeup shows you value your appearance, and there is nothing wrong with that.

And that is how I do my makeup.

All advice is welcome.

WARNING: Bungie have gone back on their advertised promise to credit extra season pass purchases. You will NOT receive Silver.,239,DestinyTheGame,351,"There’s a lot of misinformation and confusion in the comments (and people getting hung up on irrelevant details) so let me rewrite this post to be easier to follow. 

TLDR Bungie offered a pro-consumer thing, then deleted it without telling anyone.


1. Shadowkeep came out October 1st. Until mid-October, the Bungie store said this about season passes-

&gt; *Season Pass redeemed when logging in. If players already own the current Season Pass, they will receive credit toward future Seasons up until Season 11. Any credits beyond Season 11 will be exchanged for an equivalent value of Silver.


https://web.archive.org/web/20190808082916/https://bungiestore.com/products/destiny-2-shadowkeep

Please note that the asterisk applies to the season pass for both standard AND deluxe editions. 

This wording has been deleted from the current version of the page, but the references to preordering for the twintail fox skin etc still remain.

Bungie was offering this service until at least October 10th, so it was not a preorder only policy. You can see in this post on the 10th a Bungie support rep offering it to a player who hasn’t bought Shadowkeep yet.


https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253880307

2. However, at some point, Bungie reworded the Steam/Xbox/PS4 store page to its current state, removing our ability to get Silver as credit for extra season passes.

&gt;* NOTE: A second Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe purchase does not grant additional Seasons or Silver. If you’re purchasing Shadowkeep on a second platform, please select the Standard Edition.


3. Bungie never alerted customers that they were changing this policy, so this lead to many customers over the past month applying for and getting denied Silver on the Bungie support forum. 

My intention for making this post was to alert other people who, like myself, didn’t know that the “Silver credit” offer was quietly cancelled without players being informed. 

To everyone who politely engaged in discourse in this thread, thank you and have a nice day. To the people who insulted and berated me while not actually understanding the situation, I hope you have a nice day too. Maybe the next time Bungie changes something you enjoy you’ll understand what it’s like 🤷‍♂️",0.56,0.0,126.0,0.0,0.05,2243.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Smurfs ruin the game.,137,leagueoflegends,563,"Edited for clarifying shit because I wrote this while tilted and tired. *Italics for where I clarified/added on.*

And yes this is a shitpost. I was tilted and had nothing better to do. 

Also it is a somewhat misleading title. and can people read the fucking thing before commenting.

Smurfs ruin the game (in lower elos) because they create an unfair balance, do not contribute to the overall game in a positive way and they discourage new players from joining.

Players are meant to be playing in a *relatively* equal playing field. That is the whole point of the ranked system. As much shit as it gets the ranked system it works OK. *According to comments the old system made it easier for smurfs to pass through than it is now.* The smurfs simply dominate and it's not fun for anyone except maybe the smurf. The whole ranking system is useless if there are smurfs. Below is the game that I recently played. The graph is from [u.gg](https://u.gg) and it shows carry scores. Guess who the smurf was? Yeah ~~I wish it was me~~ it was the LeBlanc. She got to the point where you saw her then your screen turned grey.

[fuck you LB](https://preview.redd.it/ecg15e6baum21.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd063092ebef73db7eda01afd78b9164a33fdf6a)

Smurfs do not contribute to the game positively. At all. It's a problem. It's similar to having a fed yas or a successful inting sion on the other team. It's unstoppable. It just becomes a game you wait until you ff at 20. I hate that. I play games to have fun. I also play competitively because I want to be better ~~but I also have a massive ego that needs tending~~. When smurfs are on your team you get bored. You don't see action. Look at the Illaoi. She was dogshit and I kicked her ass in lane. Yet in theory she won. Yeah, it happens when people carry one deadweight. It's not uncommon. But you know what happened? We won every lane except LBs. Just from that she carried the whole game. She ended 25/0. As someone who joined towards the end of S8, this is a major turnoff.

New players suck. I know it. You know it. We all know who they are. New games are hard. It's a fact. And some players try and help them. That's how I got sucked into LoL. I got invited to a discord with a few other people and it was fun. But that doesn't happen to anyone. Games have learning curves and usually within a few nights you can decide if your going to stick to a game or not. If you face smurfs you will feel as if you have gotten nowhere on the learning curve and you end up dropping the game. It's a universal concept in any competitive game. It needs to stop because it's exclusive and a major turnoff in the gaming culture.

&#x200B;

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

tl:dr Smurfing in low elo isn't good because it misses the point of the ranked system, it turns off players and is an unpleasant experience.  There should be a system where smurfs have a fast pass so that they don't have to waste timed against low elos.

Everything below this was added after posting.

Some people are ignoring the core problem. I don't think smurfs should not exist. They should not be a low elo. The comments talk about the streamers climbing and comparing to a past system. I'm a relatively new player and I think that smurfs should not linger in low elo. There should be some sort of ez pass or some shit because 1) smurf don't need to waste their time in low elo (T1/Moe) 2) low elo players shouldn't have to deal with them.

Also some people are bringing up smurfs as the reason I can't climb and not sure how that is relevant. My winrate is above 50% and people are missing the point. I'm looking for a solution to smurfing.

&#x200B;

For the learning experience argument it is valid that you can learn from smurfs but I'm looking for a way for them not to be playing in a elo they don't belong to. No shit sherlock I can learn how to lane from a diamond smurf but I shouldn't be playing with a diamond smurf in silver.

There is no point in bringing up ranks and stats just try and contribute to a solution.

Possible solution(s):

1. Bringing back the older system. u/LongSwordsForLIife mentioned that it filtered out smurfs faster which is good, because players like T1/Moe should not be spending 20+ games to just get out of silver.
2. Have a banner or border that is always there. Maybe a black flag saying ""I'm a smurf you can ff at 15 don't waste my time""
3. Filter out smurfs so that low elo games are more enjoyable. People get turned off quick by facing smurfs.",0.54,0.0,21.0,-0.4,0.4,4519.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The whole controversy that surrounds Pokemon SwSh is getting really embarrassing,27,NintendoSwitch,323,"First thing first,  I do see where the fandom as a whole is coming from with worries and complaints regarding new Pokemon game - while it's not something that affects me personally as a newer fan, there are a lot of valid reasons to be disappointed, be it missing pokemon, desire for some specific features that aren't there, or just dissatisfaction with direction of the franchise as a whole. Still, they way situation was approached over those months frankly gives me a strong feeling of second-hand embarrassment and disappointment. There's a lot of reasons why, so I'll do my best to keep things short and to the point:

1. Brigading and tribalism. Maybe it's a given for any controversial situation in any fandom (especially on Reddit), but for anyone even remotely interested in a new release, discussions are simply impossible - trying to express any positive opinion about the game or just discuss something else aside of pokedex situation will get you downvoted fast, and threads are dominated by the same highly-upvoted complaints for many months because of that - situation got so severe that a decent chunk of r/pokemon netizens had to leave the subreddit and create their own ( r/PokemonSwordAndShield ) to have any sort of reasonable discussion. Speaking simply, you're getting punished for daring to like the game, and when that's the situation community *about* liking the games ends up being, then something's clearly messed up.
2. Related to above, the threads that get constantly hijacked by angry fans regardless the topic. Trailer or gameplay video? Angry fans complain about pokedex. New feature or info? Angry fans complain about pokedex. Some cool piece of fanart? Angry fans complain about pokedex. Someone made a random poll to discuss favorite new pokemon? You get the idea. It's not that criticism shouldn't be addressed, but it seems like some Pokemon fans (a decent amount of them in fact) just don't have any boundaries at all, and they're ready to turn every thread into personal ramblings about how they're upset about certain features - which, combined with aforementioned brigading and downvoting, really poisons any discussions that could be made about the project.
3. ""Armchair gamedevs"" and attacks against developers. While two above are embarrassing in their stupid amount of hostility, this one is embarrassing exactly due to ""amount of stupid"". Some downright claim that GameFreak is ""lazy"" while barely having knowledge/involvement in making games, some pre-emptively jump the horse and complain about features that weren't even announced, some just push their ""real and holy"" vision of what franchise should be down other people's throats while stating that they're objectively right. It's not the first time I see people being know-it-alls about specific games and series, but its the first time I see so many of them in one place - with that sheer amount of true and honest talent, you may as well start your own company.
4. ***Actual*** attacks against developers - from metabombing their other projects (like it was with Little Town Hero), to all sorts of personal threats. I don't feel like I even need to comment on it.
5. All in all, just general sense of entitlement that leaks into all above? Some fans (again, a disappointingly large amount of fans) *demand* a Pokemon game that they should like. GameFreak doesn't satisfy their tastes, and for them, it justifies attacking other fans, ruining any discussions about the game, berating developers for ""laziness"", ruining scores for their other games, and actively harrassing them on social networks. Instead of expressing criticisms in constructive way, waiting out for another entry or just simply moving away from the franchise, people go to great lengths to harm other people over a game they kinda didn't like, and that's just the kind of behavior that alienates you from any interactions and joy you could potentially have with the fandom.

Maybe it's just all me, and I'm being hyperbolic about all above? I don't even know at this point - I'm not usually the type to make rambly rant posts, but all things above seems to continue for months without any end in sight, so I think it should be addressed at least somehow.",0.52,0.0,80.0,0.2,0.30000000000000004,4228.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Kakaos hypocrisy and my story of getting banned,0,blackdesertonline,221,"Hello Reddit,

I have been playing this Game for years now under the name Contash.

There has been a lot of uproar around me.

The rumors might or might not be true.

But this Thread is not about the controversy surrounding me,

it's about the way the Black Desert GMs handle bans.

There has been a lot of dispute around this topic as well.

Not long ago a whole guild was being threatened to get banned

because of an impostor on a Discord.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/aysawp/control\_your\_cms\_and\_gms\_on\_your\_official\_discord/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/aysawp/control_your_cms_and_gms_on_your_official_discord/)

Also there were ban waves where a significant part of the punished people were innocent.

[https://community.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?threads/banwave-update-on-follow-up-measures.428601/](https://community.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?threads/banwave-update-on-follow-up-measures.428601/)

One might think they would change the way they handle bans,

after so many falsely accused players.

Now here is what happened to me:

First they suspended my account and told me that my account details might be compromised and asked for my ID card.

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225286398509125/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225286398509125/unknown.png)

So I instantly fulfilled their request.

I didn't get any official message from their support,

not even confirmation of verification.

It took them a week to give me any information.

Which then was completely unrelated to the first Ticket.

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225604725211157/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225604725211157/unknown.png)

12.1.5. I never ddos'd anyone, I never spammed and I never denied anyone any services,

except if openworld pvp falls under that term.

So does that mean, that anyone who enjoys pvp (which is an aspect of the game) can get banned now?

12.1.6. As many other players I am using Exit Lag it is a VPN, which even get's advertised by their Twitch Partners.

Yet using a VPN is also my right, as an EU Citizen to protect my self online.

Despite that, most Guildmaster Accounts get played by multiple people, even on stream , some people logon for friends for daily rewards when they are on vacation and the list goes on.

I am not saying it's wrong, but why would they enforce this rule only when they see fit.

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/487439383742644224/582142354606129167/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/487439383742644224/582142354606129167/unknown.png)

Should I feel like this is fair towards me or is it a personal attack ?

If someone uses your in game name on another application and acts like a fool , can they threaten you

In game ? and your whole guild ?

I got banned, because they can ban you and anyone they want to, whenever they see fit.

Using article 12 which is ambiguous and can be interpreted however they want.

[Announcement] Provisional policy change with regard to r/Turkey,222,europe,1117,"Hey folks!

In recent weeks we have seen that there has been a clear tendency towards brigading in submissions relating to Turkey. In addition to the harmful activities on r/europe, r/Turkey users have also attempted to doxx a Wikipedia editor. We have found the r/Turkey mod team's responses to these violations to be unsatisfactory and must therefore take protective measures from our own end. 

Accordingly, we will remove our links in the sidebar to this sub. Furthermore, we will monitor issues that include Turkey's national policy even more closely with regard to brigading and reserve the right to take further actions. That also means if the response of the mods of r/Turkey to brigades improve then we will re-add them to the sidebar.
The r/europe team will not tolerate any brigading from other subs, doxxing against users of reddit or other platforms or any other activity that violates our rules or Reddit's TOS.

It goes without saying that attempts to brigade from r/europe to any other subreddit are also against the rules, and may result in removals of the relevant posts or comments (please point them out to us if we missed them) and a possible ban of the users involved.",0.56,0.0,64.0,0.0,0.0,1190.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Men have a hard time accepting that women's preferences evolve with age because they themselves are permanently 12 years old in their desire.,0,PurplePillDebate,686,"when it comes to sex and romance, men are truly the oldest teenager in the house. its very noticeable to me how men's sexuality and preferences in women go fundamentally unchanged from whatever the fuck they start liking in middle school while women continue refining their palettes when it comes to what we like. ask a guy what kind of girls he liked when he was 13 and at 43 he probably still gets off to that shit, while literally ever girl has stories about the embarassing types of guys they used to be into in middle school, from shitty boybands to lame ass skaters who look barely alive to cringe protagonists in wattpad fanfics, we all look back at our EVOLUTION in tastes and there is a clear trend in leaving behind our ""types"" as we get older and finding beauty in new guys.

ive recently started dating a guy who by a lot of measures is less objectively attractive than guys ive dated in the past. literally the only people to comment about this to me have been my guy friends and an ex. the truly vile things ive heard from some of them is more akin to the sort of thing you might hear a bitchy teen girl say than anything i would anticipate from a grown man. like they clearly struggle with the fact that at 28 the things i genuinely find appealing in a guy are different from what i found appealing maybe even five years ago. i don't necessarily look for a floppy haired skater boy now that i'm potentially shopping for a lifetime partner. 


you might say ""beta bucks confirmed this bitch is hitting the wall"" but i mean i could easily be with the floppy haired skater boy still....i just don't want to because i'm an adult?

i was cracking up on halloween because i dressed up as ""baby one more time"" britney spears and the number of guys who were like unironically like ""you look so hot"" / ""this is my fantasy"" was so cringe to me. like grow the fuck up you are literally balding. NO 30 YEAR OLD WOMAN would be like ""wow you dressed as edward cullen i LOVED him a decade ago this is so fucking hot"" ???

so next time you see a grown ass woman with a guy you might think of as ""beta bucks"" consider the fact that women don't have dick and balls and we dont pine over the same shit that we were nutting to at 12 for the rest of our lives.",0.5,0.0,141.0,-0.09583333333333334,0.37083333333333335,2254.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

PSA: Naming things after cartoon characters helps nobody,26,sysadmin,340,"Welcome to the new year!

&#x200B;

Sometimes you might be tempted to name your servers and switches after your favorite characters *because its memorable and I like my servers,* [*they are my family*](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/)...

&#x200B;

Please do yourself the favor of adopting a standardized naming scheme for your organization moving forward, as having a domain full of

*Ariel, Carbon, Helium, Rocky, Genie, Lilo, Stitch, Shrek, Donkey, Saturn, Pluto, Donald, BugsBunny, and everything else taken from the compendium of would-be andrew warhol pop culture art installations*

is not helpful for determining infrastructure integration and service relationships when comes time to turn things off or replace the old. You shouldn't have to squawk test every piece of your infrastructure after the original engineer stood it up in the first place and left... leaving you asking the question ""what does this thing do?""

&#x200B;

Things you *should* be putting in names (to name a few for example):

Site, Building, Room, Zone, Function code (like DC for domain controllers, FS for fileservers, etc), Numerical identifier

&#x200B;

This way, others who have no idea what is going on can walk in and recognize what something does by inference of the descriptors in the name. If you do adopt a standard, please DOCUMENT IT and ENFORCE the practice across your organization with training and knowledge management.

I find the current state of the community just unbelievable,11,thedivision,154,"Why is everyone acting as if the game is bad or that they paid money and didn't get a product? Everyone of you nagging about the game has probably at least 100 hours in it and you're talking as if Ubi and Massive are leaving the game behind and pretending it's fine. Well they're not, they're working on everything, listening to the community but for some reason you're expecting everything to play out fine and great in 1 day. Too much negativity around, let's be a bit more positive. It's okay to report that you have issues, to post some suggestions (honestly my favorite posts here), but ""I'm leaving"" and ""the devs need to get their shit together"" posts are useless, meaningless, time-wasting  and pathetic. The devs have shown and said before that they're lurking around so let's be positive, have patience, *I BEG YOU GUYS*, let's be a good community so both we and the devs can make the Division even greater.

I'm sorry if I sound salty or if I offended anyone but it's so painful to see this treatment to a game with so much potential. Posting negativity is no different than stabbing ourselves in the back. Let's have some faith and keep in mind the comeback in endgame that other Ubi games and especially TD1 made in the past.

Edit: many seem to have misunderstood. I don't want anyone to stop talking, on the contrary, I want more posts, just not negative posts that lead to nowhere and people going around talking shit about the devs. That's all.",0.51,0.0,59.0,-0.125,0.7,1461.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

[Spoilers] This sub is trying it's best to ruin GOT,98,gameofthrones,244,"I used to come to this sub almost daily to get my fix for game of thrones. I enjoyed reading people's commentary, theories and of course the reaction posts from people who had recently started the show. Ever since this season has aired, this sub has become almost toxic. Everyone is nitpicking the smallest of details and claiming that it ruins the whole show. Instead of watching with as a fan, everyone seems to be watching as critics. 


I remember watching S8E3 last week and being on the edge of my seat the entire time. My jaw dropped straight out of a cartoon when Lyanna Mormont died and my arms flew into the air like a referee in football announcing a field goal was good when Arya made the kill. I was so excited to come read everything people had to say the following morning on the sub.  Instead, people were complaining that it was too dark for them to really see? People complaining about who made the kill as if the person who's literally been training for years with a group of trained assassins for this moment wasn't the perfect choice. People seeming to be dying to find any negative they could so they could write a post about it.


How about instead of acting like a jilted lover trying to find negatives because the show is leaving you, just appreciate everything its put in front of you for the last 10 years? This has been one of the best shows I've ever seen on TV and it seems like everyone is doing their best to make sure it's not remembered that way.


Jesus guys, it's a show about dragons and ice zombies. Logic was never a priority to start with...


Also, I don't care about the cup 🙄 


Edit: Well after a couple of days of just reading comments as they come through, here is what I feel.  I appreciate both sides of the argument.  Didn't mean to offend anyone with the logic comment. My point was simply that the fact that people are mad about things that they didn't think were realistic are countered by the fact that there's zombies and dragons. If GOT wants to be a bit liberal with what they think the story line should be then that's their choice.  If a dragon and zombies are completely realistic, but the best pirate on the ocean can't shoot down the dragon because of the logic then I don't know where we draw the line. I admittedly am not a fan of the fantasy genre so setting up rules and sticking to them doesn't seem feasible to me if you're going to have dragons anyways. 


For the people who rationalized their disagreement with my opinion in a civilized, calm manner I understand where you're coming from and see why you feel the way you do.  I appreciate the rarity of people like you, especially on this site.  For the people who clearly just come to posts like these ones to throw out insults and talk shit because you think it will grab you a few upvotes, congrats on the few you received.


My overall point wasn't to say the show is amazing and everyone should like it. My point was simply to say that criticism of the show has gotten so intense and aggressive that nobody can post anything positive for the first 48 hours after an episode or else their inbox gets filled with unneccessary rude comments to the point where fewer and fewer people even bother posting anymore because its not worth the backlash.  People like myself enjoy reading the positive posts on this sub and the theories, but now everyone is afraid to even post them anymore. It takes a couple days for the pitchforks to go away at which point I've already taken in enough negativity to not bother reading this sub for the rest of the week.


And to prove my point about it even further, look through the comments. A majority of the comments that weren't shutting on my post or the show were downvoted or met with petty insults.

____________________

What's a blatant lie? Acknowledging the fact that these protesters aren't peaceful or innocent?

> There are so many sources of people protesting peacefully

Yeah. All of which is propaganda.

There are also many sources that show evidence of this not being the case.

Apparently you are unaware of them because all you consume is literal propaganda.

> that to try and spin this as anything else is at best ignorant and at worst purposefully disingenuous.

This is beyond ridiculous.

Here are your [""peaceful protesters"" trying to murder a police officer](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=714435965642812) by kicking him down an escalator then forming a lynchmob to beat him to death. Broken up in the last second by a single non-terrorist left within the midst of the crowd.

The propaganda you consume is so completely censored that you aren't even aware of the constant criminal acts and constantly escalating violence of the protesters and you actually believe it's OTHERS who are ignorant and purposefully disingenuous.

There is so much conclusive and undeniable evidence of the protesters being violent that it takes effort to continue promoting the blatant lie that they are peaceful.


But yeah: Those ""peaceful protesters"" are [totally not assaulting police officers all the time](https://twitter.com/LIANG_555/status/1153695764981284865). The police officers are just [faking their injuries](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAZJmQ6UYAELEuM?format=jpg&name=medium). This is all imaginary fake news. Probably some deepfake created by the Chinese gubermint, am I right? I guess [this is just a peaceful, innocent protester](https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/hong-kong-protest-sh-ps-190805_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg) throwing a rubber prop as a sign of love and peace.


Just because Western media will never show you these things doesn't mean it doesn't happen. By the way: In the West these protesters would be tasered or shot and end up in hospital/jail. In China, they continue being tolerated. What does that tell you? 


[Very peaceful protestors](https://i.redd.it/idj61ciarpb31.jpg). Making makeshift weapons and armor and throwing bricks at police that they [bring in with entire carts](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/EF8F/production/_88172316_57bd2765-e6f7-4646-a083-6813910125a5.jpg) or [literally destroy public roads for so they have something to throw at police](https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/hong-kong-protests-june-12-intl-hnk/h_1ab73f5f942eeade95e99433344fc078) and fling at police and buildings with [slingshots after building barricades in the street and setting things on fire](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F509087626%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale) is very ""peaceful"" indeed.   

[Here is how your ""peaceful protesters"" react to security telling them to stop rioting](https://youtu.be/MmbRh_S_dhY?t=29)      

These terrorist protesters [regularly start lynchmobs to string up and beat people for opposing them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlMbPi0PPwA), [send journalists reporting negatively on them to the hospital](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Hong-Kong-US-Flags-Wielding-Protesters-Occupy-Airport-Assault-Chinese-Journalist-20190813-0013.html), [attack tourists from the mainland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qht5-ArZroE&feature=youtu.be&t=75).

They are [foreign-supported](https://i.redd.it/ols2csc7l5g31.jpg) traitors.   

They are traitors who [violently invade government buildings](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hong-kong-protesters-storm-legislative-council-building-zsfv6dpfk) while [flying hostile foreign flags](https://globalnews.ca/video/5465241/protesters-hang-union-jack-flag-inside-hong-kong-legislature) and [attack police with makeshift chemical weapons](https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/hong-kong-july-1-protests-intl-hnk/h_0cb11bb29c0ce377409526c26397bb5e).

The protesters [constantly lie and use fake news to victimize themselves](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/07/what-my-viral-hong-kong-protest-picture-taught-me-about-fake-news/). They constantly [provoke violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug0ZB7mY_T4) and then [fake injury and victimize themselves](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12254396).    

The protests against the rioting pro-democracy protesters [are actually larger](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019450/government-supporters-turn-out-hundreds-thousands-hong-kong) than the pro-democracy protests. But hey, I bet people are just evil and brainwashed by the CCP. [These police officers are just faking](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2018/02/22/bricks-thrown-officers-attacked-and-a-warning-shot-fired-in-video-clips-shown-in-hong-kong-court-on/) being attacked. It's really just the police oppressing the people and being unfair and evil. Protesters [throwing molotov cocktails at police](https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/hong-kong-molotov-mo_hpMain_20190811-054553_16x9_992.jpg) is totally normal and not an act of terrorism. 

So, ask yourself: What does the fact that all evidence showing the protesters in a bad light is being censored and not reported on by the media you consume tell you? What does it tell you that you refuse to research the subject and instead bought fully into anti-Chinese propaganda?

As for how people react and what they believe, here is a good comparison:    
https://old.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/crnusn/two_nearly_identical_pics_two_nearly_identical/

People are brainwashed and your comment demonstrates beautifully how perfectly the anti-Chinese propaganda works.    

So, need any more info? Any more proof? Any more evidence of the propaganda you believe being blatant lies? What will it take to convince you? Do you personally need to have a brick thrown at you by the protesters before you believe they are violent?

_______

People on this website are becoming more and more brainwashed against China. Every day there are more anti-Chinese threeads on the frontpage and any and all dissent is being heavily censored. Everyone contradicting the anti-Chinese circlejerk gets instantaneously downvoted and banned. Any comment showing evidence of anti-Chinese fake news gets deleted by mods. This is becoming genuinely dangerous.

What can people do about this? Is there a way for people to organize? Shouldn't there be a forum where people can create content to counter the constant propaganda spread by the protesters and Western propaganda media? I'm not from China myself but why aren't Chinese people working together to fight against this? Why isn't anyone standing up? Why aren't the comment sections being flooded with opposing views so that they become uncensorable? If people don't stand up to these protesters now, they will eventually win the world's sympathy by making themselves look like the victims representing the will of the people and ruin China's future by turning the world against it.",0.49,0.0,238.0,-0.20625,0.5437500000000001,7236.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Legacy Official Statement for Winter Alliances and their removal from active combat.,19,Eve,380,"This is an official offer from Legacy Coalition to the non-Fraternity and non-CURE members of Winter Coalition.

Legacy Coalition holds no ill will towards the Smaller alliances of Winter Coalition. Alliances like ATF, Vindi, Lorde etc. This also includes the Chinese corps and alliances within Winterco that would like to chose a new leader. We bear no ill will to the Chinese community despite what Fraternity would tell you.

With the recent admission by Fraternities leader that Detroid can and likely will be lost this is us offering a hand of redemption. We have no intentions for more space, we do not want Wicked Creek, or Scalding Pass or Cache. There is some desire by allies of Legacy for Detroid and some of Insmother. But even that, without the main enemies of Legacy, we would be fine to see you fight over. We would love to see you all develop and grow.

Our conditions are simple. You can continue to work with Fraternity and retain your honour. But you must let us know you would like to persist upon their demise or we will assume you will need to be purged with them. You will have one week to inform me by evemail on the character Vily. We intend to clear if possible every Fraternity structure and Sov strucutre in the south of EVE. Once the purge has been completed as long as you do not work in any with NORAUS, ELO KNIGHT, WIND SPIRITS, FRATERNITY ALLIANCE, SNUFF BOX, and CURE ALLIANCE we will treat you much the same as we would Providence or any other neutral entity. If you chose to work with them we will treat you as our blood enemy and hound you until you die.

I feel really bad for the lady in the GoJek incident,0,singapore,158,"Like, the amount of shame and witchhunting being carried out is way overboard in my opinion. Just look at facebook, you can't scroll more than a few seconds without something referencing her. The comments too - apparently people have dug out her name and someone even said they (I'm guessing Singaporeans) should make sure she's unemployed her whole life. 

I mean, sure she did something dumb, but is this amount of witchhunting really justified? Her public life is pretty much over at this point. How will she feel okay going out in public, be it to the supermarket or commuting to work? She's gonna feel like everyone's watching her and shaming her. Her life will never be the same again for a long time. 

To add to this, I personally think she has some form of paranoia which explains her actions. She may have actually been scared and lashed out as an emotional fight or flight response. Regardless of what it is, other people have done way worse things - there's so many news reports stating the name of child abusers and molesters - much more abhorrent crimes - but instead we're all talking about this incident because it was recorded on video? I really don't understand. 

I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. This massive internet witch hunt has gone way too far, in my opinion a far worse misdeed than what it targets. I just hope she'll be okay. 

Edit: In recent years we Singaporeans are trying to be more concerned with mental health awareness - yet when we see a potential case, literally nobody entertains the notion that she could be suffering from some paranoid delusions?

Verzetteln sich die BEANS gerade?,2,rocketbeans,74,"Hallo liebe Leute,  

habt ihr auch gerade das Gefühlt, dass sich die BEANS verzetteln?  

**Bsp 1:** Die Flummi Open haben dafür gesorgt, dass wochenlang kaum richtiges Programm kam. Ja, live war es geilo, aber mein RBTV Genuss davor hat gelitten.  

**Bsp 2:** Game Fights wird abgesetzt, obwohl es bei der Community  sehr beliebt war. Begründet wird die Entscheidung damit, dass die Teilnehmer keine Lust mehr auf ""Streiten"" haben.  

**Bsp 3:** Budi sitzt Tage lang an einem Artikel 13 Video, anstatt mit Widrian eine neue Folge Battle Toads zu recorden. Da heute das Gesetzt beschlossen wurde, dürfte sein Videa dazu schon jetzt viel zu spät sein.  

**Bsp 4:** Die Bohnen geben hier auf Reddit und im Forum fast nur bockige Antworten ab. Infos muss man Ihnen fast aus der Nase ziehen.

Irgendwie löst das das Gefühl bei mir aus, dass sich die BEANS momentan was ihr Programm angeht auf dem Holzweg befinden.

"In light of Valve's statement, I want to call out the Reddit Dota community.",4,DotA2,108,"I want to remind everyone that the whole cause of this giant drama and rumor about the Chinese government banning Kuku was started by Gods with this post:

https://twitter.com/BTSGoDz/status/1066118090306404353

Then a day latter Cyborgmatt follows with this:

https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/1066266269278760960

With people like EE fanning the flames with tweets like this:

https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/1069042134169268229

I think this is the point when the drama exploded, and a few days latter we have casters that threaten to not go to the event if Kuku is banned (assuming by the Chinese government), all based on a rumor with NO evidence other than tweets from Godz and Cyborgmatt. There was even a tweet from Col that called out and contradicted Matt's claims 

https://twitter.com/coL_Beef/status/1066387077426745344

and yet everyone continues to assume that this ban was real. While TNC definitely did not handle the situation well, this sort of community overreaction based a baseless rumor is just ridiculous and no doubt worsened the situation. 

Lets be real, Dota 2 is a very small portion of the gaming market in China, do people honestly think that the ChongQing government (the 3rd largest city in China) even knows who Kuku is, let alone care about what he said in a pub match?

META: YouTube Links no longer allowed on r/linux,10,linux,309,"As of today, most YouTube links are no longer allowed on r/linux as a standalone submission. Please use reddit video upload functionality, or free alternatives such as PeerTube @ https://joinpeertube.org/en/

Some exceptions are videos from large open source projects are set to be allowed by automod. Message the mods or reply in this thread if you feel something should be whitelisted. YouTube videos are also still allowed to be linked in comments or as part of a broader post (such as a video demo of related content). Additionally, you can post YouTube mirrors of content in the comments.

There are various reasons that led to this decision:

* YouTube uses a lot of non-free software
* Most YouTube videos posted here are spam
* Lots of YouTube videos are also not even on topic or are a meme
* PeerTube and free software has matured enough to push it over YouTube

Other video sources are currently allowed, although please do consider free software such as the previously mentioned PeerTube.

Edit: Because it appears to need to be said, do not break copyright and upload it to reddit/PeerTube/etc yourself. The content creator will have to do that, so try contacting them, or if you feel it's exceptional it can be modmailed for approval.

Pulled some stats from the last month: 42 total YouTube submission breakdown: 11/42 YouTube links were from regular YouTubers, four of which were related to Pinephone (they seem to be devs although this needs confirming, and in that case they can be whitelisted) and one could have used their alternate link available in their YouTube submission. Another 4/42 were from big projects and are whitelisted. 27/42 were pure spam, with five being from one person and two other individuals using bot submission scripts and one user using multiple accounts to post two times. So, how we can successfully allow the 5/42 that would be removed by the new rule is something that we will take constructive feedback on.

That's no more a legitimate build than the Bee+Hawk combo was in BL2.

When a few guns are so massively more powerful than others, a nerf is required to keep the game balanced and fun. This rampant whine wank is ridiculous and directly contrary to a healthy shelf-life for the game.

You want characters using a large variety of legendary guns, not two or three that dramatically outclass everything else available! And it's absurd to expect them to buff *literally every other piece of gear in the game* to bring them up to par with a few overpowered pieces.

None of this matters, her tone changes and now it seems like I have a red dot on my head. She says she doesn't understand why libertarians can't just be democrats. I tell her I have a degree in economics and that some of these issues aren't as clear and simple as she might make them out to be.

I still thought perhaps the night could still be salvaged, but no sir. Icing on the cake is we both understand the night is over, and I go to at least give her a hug goodbye and she puts her hands up making pushing away gestures lol

I am not saying what caelynn did was right, she lied and manipulated the situation but I do feel that Blake also manipulated the truth with his exposing the texts and crying on his Instagram stories. Yes, someone posted the timeline of their relationship showing caelynn in a bad light as well but I want you all to remember we do not know their relationship fully to judge and he could have truly been leading her on more than the past timeline posted shows. 

Kristina is not my fav in the franchise even tho she is so beautiful but I feel I also have to mention he treated her kinda shitty on their paradise date that I’m not sure can be blamed on editing?? He called her immature for telling him she had romantic feelings for him and not playing into the narrative he wanted. Correct me if I’m wrong, I’m really not trying to start shit on the sub but just trying to show someone’s perspective that isn’t team Blake. She’s having his back now, but that doesn’t say much in the scheme of this storyline? 

I have seen all the comments from dean about  Blake how he slut shamed caelynn by posting the texts, I just wanna make it clear I don’t believe Blake slut-shamed caelynn but I DO agree with deans interpretation that Blake did invade her privacy (my main irritation). Understand none of us have as many followers as Blake but I still could not imagine posting text screenshots with anyone in my life if I had to clear my name if rumors were going around about me. Maybe I’m naive for not understanding the spotlight he’s under to feel the need to clear my name, I still think it’s fucked up!

"If you play PVE, masterwork your armor. PVP too. Just do it. 25% damage reduction is a good thing.",36,DestinyTheGame,243,"I found this video that explains masterworking armor.

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voKKiKhC8is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voKKiKhC8is)

&#x200B;

**tldr to save watching a 10 min video** : having 5 pieces of armor gives 25% damage resistance, which is effectively 33% more health.

So set your nightfall card to Solar singe, then put on 5 pieces of solar masterworked armor.  The singe lets you do 25% more damage, but you also take 25% more from solar sources.  Masterworked armor effecticely means you do 25% more, but take no additional damage.  Now you increased your score multiplier, but there are zero negative effects heading your way.

Masterwork 3 pieces, one of each elemental type, and you get 5% damage reduction from all elemental sources.

Then when in your super, you get 1% per tier overall damage resistance.  So 5 masterworked pieces of armor means you get 25% more damage resistance during your super, and this is the only effect masterworked armor has in pvp, but its pretty huge.  The hunter using his super that seems unkillable, while you seem to die more easily using the same super, likely has all masterworked armo, and you don't.  he essentially has 33% more health than you do while in his super.

In pve its useful at all times AND while in your super.

I keep reading about people with hundreds of cores, and almost every time i find out they don't masterwork armor, and often only a few guns.  Orbs are a huge advantage.  Damage resistance is a huge advantage.  If you join my lfg to do a nightfall and have nothing masterworked, i consider you a liability, not an asset to the fireteam.  Id rather play with someone who has masterworks and is making orbs, vs someone who thinks just having thunderlord or whisper is going to carry them through.",0.52,0.0,98.0,0.7,0.6000000000000001,1798.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

You wanna take credit for my work? You wanna tell me you hope my family dies? Want to try to fight me for winning-out against your bullshit? Ok how's losing your ability to work in this city and a few years in jail as well as public humiliation?,1421,ProRevenge,585,"We have to get a few details about me out of the way:   


Backstory TLDR: Do not fuck with me. I'm blunt and stubborn. Also I'm better at my job than you will ever be so just get over that now. Also I hate my career field. I work in tech but I'm not going to be more specific than that.  


A note on the stubborn-ness: I am the most stubborn, and blunt (rude if you push me) person you will ever meet. I expect everyone (Doubly so for management) to do the right thing even when no one is looking. One of the things I have learned is that narcissists and sociopaths cannot fucking stand me. They will actively melt down if they work with people like myself. Those people thrive when people have to 'be nice.' The exception to my stubborn bluntness? If you work under me. I help everyone working under me with everything they need 100% of the time and am super friendly unless they give me a reason not to be. I treat people under me (in terms of technical position and in the companies hierarchy) like royalty and the people beside and above me like ""You should be at least as competent as myself, no excuses.""   


Example: If you lie about me/to me? Well I had better be getting an open, and public apology (to the people who you lied to) with admission of guilt or I'm going to make you fucking regret it. Best not be treating anyone else below you bad either. Lots of managers have a problem with this for some reason. Don't want this to happen? Don't lie.  


Now with that said I have a constant wave of job opportunities. Every company I've ever worked for (including the one that fired me) begging to have me back at a higher pay rate than what I made when I worked there. Actually about 25% more than the highest pay in the country I live in. So I'm not in any position to care if someone is going to fire me.  


Now thats out of the way, at my current job I've worked here for about 2.5 years. I took this job because it was going to allow me to have the time off I wanted: About 35 days of PTO, and 10 weeks (first 2 unpaid) of vacation time. Its a long story but basically I need the time off. I was hired in at about 50% of the standard rate of pay for this reason. Contractually I can take this time off any time I want. I could, if I so desired, leave work mid day and go on vacation.  


When I first started the company laid off every other ""IT Guy"" after about a year aside from two. Those guys are mostly there to cover me leaving suddenly and if someone needs to pull something while I work on something else.  


My previous manager actually recommended me to manage the department but I didn't want to take it so the company gave me an open door to take said position any time I wanted and they would just demote anyone in said position. This is where Sociopath comes in: To manage.  


First day he pulls us all (My team + one more) into a meeting and talks about how hes a 'nice guy' but is going to drive us to work extra hard. This is where the first altercation occurs ""Yeah how is that the case? \[Other team\] is purely reactionary and our team has literally no issues inside the company and 100% of our work is completed at nearly 3 times the rate of any other business in the area?"" ""We will hold questions for private meetings."" ""Ok fair enough.""  


He pulls me in and the first thing out of his mouth is to yell at me: ""I never want you to question me ever again!"" I was honestly stunned. ""Excuse me?"" ""You will do what I say when I say! NOW GET OUT!""  


He wraps up the 'meeting' by saying ""I'm really glad to have gotten this job because I cannot leave this town due to the fact that I am obligated to watch my kids half of the year. So I can't wait to get to know all of you!""  


I immediately went to HR  as soon at the meeting was over and explained the situation. Thing is HR is the guy who hired me, and we like each other a lot. He tells me ""Ok, well, unfortunately it would be against company policy to fire him this quickly. Also I have to take his side of the story first.""  


He didn't 'yell' at me after I went and spoke to HR but called me in and said ""Listen, they are telling me to apologize to you and thats just not going to happen. I'm your boss its my right to treat you how I see fit. I didn't realize you were a rat, but now that I know that I'm afraid that I am going to be extra hard on you. Better do what I say or its your job!""  


 I replied ""Its not your job to yell at people and maybe you should understand that. If you were half as competent as you want to seem I don't think you would ever have a reason to yell at anyone. Also if reporting behavior that is against company policy makes me a rat, then being a rat must be a good thing."" He just yelled ""GET THE FUCK OUT!"" and pointed at the door. I replied ""I'm afraid I'm going to have to go to HR again about your behavior if you don't apologize now."" Which I did.  


The issue? Well I live in a one party state for recording conversations. So I recorded said conversation.  


Three weeks later and HR has decided to keep him on because we are still way ahead of everyone in terms of metrics. Since then my team and the other team has gone from loving their job to hating it. Everyone is reporting to me that he is screaming at them constantly but only in private. He doesn't even speak to me. The way he is treating the guys under me is what was really getting to me. They are HIS EMPLOYEES. He SHOULD NOT be treating them this way. I hate to use a quote from the office here but Micheal Scott is 100% correct: ""A manager is not here to hire and fire, but to lead and inspire.""  


Now we are supposed to have certain metrics passed down to us by management but he has 'decided against that' to 'keep morale up.' However I knew what he was up to. So I went to my friend in HR and didn't tell him that he wasn't sending me the metrics (which he is required to do as per company policy) and had him send me a copy of everyone's metrics early ""but keep it on the down low!""So he did.  


For several months I told my team and the people under me ""Just hold out on quitting he won't be here for long, trust me.""  


Slowly things between myself and him escalate. I make decisions that he doesn't like because ""You didn't run that past me first."" In reference to my vacations and days off. Contractually I don't have to do this and to be blunt I cant fucking stand him so hes just SOL when it comes to me not being there. This leads to several times of him trying to scream at me while I sat there and was 100% calm and patient but blunt and moving in my position that I can take leave when ever I want contractually and he is just going to have to get over that.  


One of the things I specifically remember him yelling at me the last time: ""You will do whatever I tell you when ever I tell you. If I throw a ball and say fetch you will fucking retrieve it. Do you understand?""   


At this point I lost my patients and said ""Are you done yet? Ok great you are going to listen to me now! You are hands down the worst manager I have ever worked under. You are unproductive, and the least competent. The other two guys metrics have been falling since you have been hired...""   


Him: ""Because your dumbass never listens to me. You are the problem here not me get out NNNNNNOOOOOOWWWW!""   


Me: ""Are you done? Because I think you are going to want to hear what I have to tell you! Your absolute childish behavior is unacceptable and I don't think that your supervisors or HR are going to appreciate how you have treated myself or this...""  


At this point he gets up, grabs the chair in which I'm sitting, and literally rolls it towards his door screaming ""I DON'T HAVE TO FUCKING LISTEN TO A DIP SHIT LIKE YOU! I'M THE BOSS DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD!""  


I replied: ""I hope you know this can be considered assault and battery.""  


Him: ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" and he promptly rolls me out of the office.  


Now here is the thing: Before that meeting I said I wanted an HR rep to sit out side of the office and listen in. They said they couldn't do that but would place one in the meeting. He was late. He over heard he last SHUT THE FUCK UP! Just as he rolls me out into the hall. He then proceeded to look up, see HR and start sweating bullets.   


Him:""Oh...huhuh, I was... we were just joking around.""   


Looking up at him: ""No we weren't. He was just screaming at me and insulting me for no apparent reason.""  


He looks down at me hard and says: ""This team always jokes around! I mean it was just a joke!""  


I then pull out a small recorder and looked at HR and said ""Well given that you missed the meeting I think you should just review it here on this tape as this is ""just a joke"" apparently performance reviews are 'just a joke' around here now.""  


HR insists we go over the performance review. He pulls his copy out and begins going over the metrics on it talking about how bad of an employee I am. As soon as he finishes I look at the sheet of paper he is going over I pull the metrics that my buddy in HR sent me. ""No...No I'm afraid this is all wrong.""   


He looks at me ""I...I'm sorry.""   


Me: ""Oh yeah, \[buddy in HR\] sent me my metrics independent of what you sent me. In fact, and I can't believe you didn't know this, all of the metrics are review-able by any employee at any time if they make an inquiry. Actually you have failed to send us any metrics at all as is your job to do weekly.""  


The HR rep then looks at me ""Is that all?""  


Me: ""Yes.""  


HR Rep: ""Ok I think we are done here.""  


He requests that I stay, I look at him and reply: ""No, I'm afraid I'm done listening to anything you have to tell me. Afraid I have an appointment to review your behavior with HR.""  


So HR and myself review the tape and their jaws are on the floor. HR Buddy apologizes to me. They ask me what I think should happen as I was the one who was originally up for promotion. I explain that he should not only have to write a letter apologizing for his behavior in email form, but also apologize to all the teams under him in person at one time. Just after they send an email to him I drop by his office and say ""Hey man, don't worry. I didn't let them review that tape.""  


He sends an apology letter and tells me that ""You are on my good side now!""  


A few moments later HR comes down and tells him that its not enough and to have all the teams gather in front of him. In the mean time I rig up the conference room to have a typed letter of all the times he has yelled at every single person which took me all night to do.  


He comes in and makes some bullshit apology thats a non apology ""I'm sorry I was so hard on you guys. I just know your potential and....""   


I cut him off (HR isn't in the room) ""Excuse me? Thats not good enough! I'm afraid you are going to need to apologize for your actual behavior and not give an apology that sounds like ""I'm sorry I was trying to help you and you didn't like it."" No, I'm afraid you are going to need to actually apologize and admit to wrong doing and tell the actual truth!""  


At which point he visibly starts to get angry ""I...I AM APOLOGIZING!""   


Me: ""Ok go on""  


Him: \[More non apology with him being obviously fake upset.\]  


I press play on the slide show. ""Ok since you didn't get the message the first time we are going to go through these individually. On December 11 2001 you screamed at Robert Robbington where in you failed to give him a review and simply called him a dumbass."" I continue: ""You need to repeat these words exactly if you want to keep your job: ""Dear Mr. Rob, I apologize for being overtly hostile and rude. I apologize for failing at my responsibilities as a manager to both you and the team. I understand I have a problem with anger and am willing to seek help with my clear lack of empathy for other people. As such I will be signing a document admitting fault, under the circumstances that I ever hit you again I want everyone to know that I would be 100% at fault and you would not be, and proof of my misbehavior towards you as proof of my honesty in apologizing two witnesses will be signing this document.""  


As soon as I finish speaking he stands there and starts turning angrily red and says ""MrBurington, we need to speak alone. NOW!""   


I reply ""No, I'm afraid we don't. If you do not wish to apologize to Robert Robbington then you can apologize to me for this!""   


At which point I play the audio of him talking to me ""I really hope your \[family member\] dies. I mean really. I'm your boss and this is your job and you care about \[family member\]? You think I give a fuck about them or you? You could die for all I fucking care. When \[family\] dies if you mourn I'll be mocking you. I just want you to  know that. Now fuck off."" (You see after that little incident I couldn't have given a fuck if I did get fired I just wanted to ruin this guys life.)  


He immediately starts howling at me that I 'edited' the audio and runs to get HR. Shortly there after HR comes back and the entire room denies that any of this happened. We all instead go through with a plan I had from the beginning: I was going to expose him for the POS he was/is IF he does not honestly apologize and admit to actual wrong doing.  


HR then tells him hes fired. He storms off.  


Now this is where the hard core revenge part comes in. I used to work for every single IT Company in this town, or have connections to them somehow. Hell I trained at least half of the management at the last company I worked for. My words have weight. So I make calls to all of the places I have ins at which is literally everywhere in town telling them to black list this guy. However at two companies I request that if he applies I would like to show up and help them interview him. He applied to both jobs and I was sitting there in the meeting room ""Oh hey! Just wanted you to know that I knew Mr. Meet for years."" Middle of the interview I bring up his behavior with the audio from him telling me that he hopes my family member dies.   


I then tell my ex-manager: ""Also just note, you may want to write this down, all the tech jobs in our area will have a copy of this audio. So you can go ahead and explain to them why you told me this and they can relay that to me.""  


As soon as we get out into the parking lot he swings on me and starts screaming ""I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU. FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU."" I run back into the building and security detains him and calls the police (My buddy recorded this on his phone, as well as obtained a copy of the video from security)   


After a quick court case and going to jail he shows up at my house with a knife screaming ""I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU! RUIN MY CAREER JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A BITCH."" (I think he had the address from working at the company with me)   


I called the police, got my gun, and explained the situation while I waited on the cops to show up. He proceeded to be detained and got sentenced to a 2 year stent in prison.

Unpopular opinion: Season 8 EP 3 of Game of Thrones was amazing and everything it should have been.,6,television,149,"Man, what a polarizing episode, but for the people who didn’t like it and address the recurring complaints I’ve seen: 

The lighting: 

A lot of people were complaining about this, but it was supposed to be dark, disorienting, and chaotic. A large portion of these complaints are tied to streaming quality. You can’t blame GOT for that, blame HBO. 

For the Dothraki:

The Dothraki had to die in this way. Their whole fighting style is full charge overwhelming Calvary assaults. It has been noted many times throughout the show that nobody can beat the Dothraki in an open field. Their end was to set the stage that the army of the dead is so impossibly unbeatable that the can roll over the Dothraki horde with pure, relentless numbers with ease. 

This theme is also tied into the unsullied, winterfell being able to withstand any siege. Etc.


The anti-climactic night kind ending: 

For better or worse, the night king and the army of the dead have been one massive red herring for the entire show. Which is why 95% of the series they are a side looming threat. This is intentional for both the narrative and for most of the people in the in show universe. Even looking them in the face Cersei calls them a distraction. This is Game Of Thrones, not dawn of the dead. Cersei was always going to be “the final boss” and in the end this show was about Dany and co. Changing Westeros for the better through their long narratives from point A to B. 

Not enough deaths:

I really hate this one. Why kill characters just to kill them? Because you predicted it? There is no reason to just have massive gore porn when their arcs may still need concluding. It’s senseless to kill beloved characters to just have a forced emotional reaction. That would have been cheap and lazy.

I’m sorry if a large portion of you didn’t enjoy this episode, but it was a feature length epic conclusion to a major plot point where the characters fears of the looming threat finally came to fruition in a crescendo of violence and death.",0.5,0.0,99.0,0.10000000000000003,0.65,2014.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

[Spoilers] The toxic 8x3 circlejerk is a case of Dunning-Kruger en masse,103,gameofthrones,543,"The real problem with this episode and community is we've got a bunch of people flaunting their visual illiteracy and arrogantly bitching about ""bad writing"", when all they're suggesting in reality is they'd prefer it if Michael Bay had directed

Skydiving Jon is the worst crap I've ever heard and even at a level down from that people are demanding lines of dialogue and exposition to hold their hands through one of the most fantastic pieces of almost purely visual story telling we've seen in decades.

Moreover, their specific points lack all context and are explicity contradicted by a proper reading if the episode.

(From an earlier comment): 

... the criticisms and suggestions are way off base.

For example:

1.	Arya didn't have the fighting skills - This ignores set up going back to the episode 1 and Arya's first POV book chapter.
2.	 Arya teleported - She didn't. She's shown running there directly in two shots and indirectly in one.
3.	 Jon didn't fight the NK - Didn't he? I could swear I saw a drawn out dragon-dogfight over Winterfell.
4.	Tactics and set up made no sense - Did these people miss episode 2 where Tormund and Edd arrive to say time's run out and they're nearly here so stop pissing about. It's go time.
5.	 Dothraki charge was stupid - Indeed. It's shown to be impetuous and out of step with the plan (See my previous downvoted to hell post about how this fact is explicitly communicated.
6.	 No major characters died - Six major characters died; Theon, Jorah, Mel, Beric, Edd and NK. All but NK have been here since the first few episodes of S1z
7.	There were no shocking deaths - Everyone seems pretty shocked by the NK death
8.	 We see a canonical Winterfell battle map in Episode 2 - it shows that the castle is expected to be basically enveloped and that there is a choke point between the main bailey and the Godswood: Jon and Viserion are heavily implied to be at this point, that Arya must pass to get to Bran. This fits perfectly with the Jon shouts Go theory, which is significantly more useful than loljontriestoshoutthedragondead theory

This was not supposed to be a re-run of Helm's Deep - it took the medium forward - and for the people out there wishing Jon skydived off a dragon to mug the NK in the Godswood should probably just go watch Transformers if that's what good writing looks like to them.

I appreciate where some criticisms (i.e - too dark too often, Sam's over- stylised peril making him appear to die multiple times) coming from but I cannot get away from this feeling that we're being over run by whinging goons who are annoyed that the intentional lack of dialogue and exposition meant they missed the visual communication.

Message from Greece.,5,Sino,69,"Greek citizen here.

I want to express my unyielding support and admiration for China and its leadership and to share a couple of thoughts at these perilous times.

First lets start with this: the idea that the whole world stands with honk kong is far from reality and indeed very one sided.

People who know full well what american hegemonism is capable of doing is actually quite substantial. One only has to look at the statistic collected by frequent polls conducted by governments on their local population on how much they like Americans.

In greece anti-American sentiment is shared by about 70% of the population. The government is trying really hard to revert this but Americans always manage to come up with something that skyrockets that hard gained decrease in anti-american sentiment.

A little bit on the north in the balkans the anti-American sentiment is even higher. Let me not mention the Middle east, Russia, Latin america and parts of Africa.

Now trust me when i say that everyone; and i mean everyone who has any brains and is interested in politics is watching this protests knowing full well how certain people and governments that are spreading democracy and human rights are secretly or not so secretly smirking and filling their hearts with dark happiness as they watch China and its people facing difficulties.

Now and thats the most important point in my opinion.

Democracy sounds all very nice and rosy. It is a very powerful idea indeed. Let's see the turnover in the national elections for greece shall we.

Since 2000 the turnover has been arround 40-55%. That means that 1 in 2 does not go to vote.

People are completely disgusted by our politicians and their so called representative democracy.  Over and over, again and again they have misguided us, fooled us, out right lied to us. We even had a referendum and they reversed the results... (democracy....)

That sentiment is shared in most of the so called progressive democratic countries. Go converse with any hard working person. Speak about politics you are probably going to get scorned.

What iam trying to say is that democracy is just a political system. And a political system is comprised of people. I would rather have your leadership 100 times over mine and still have one party rule without any fucking vote.

Dont let them discourage you. Fuck them and their democracy. What matters is not the political system but the people that make it. And so far your leadership has done tremendous things for your people. I sincerely hope that your leadership continues to strive for the betterment of all China; you still have a lot to do; Dont let anybody stop you; Dont let anybody belittle you; Stand proud god dammit.

You have a history of 5000 years. Your people have gone through some of the hardest times and yet here you are. 5 thousand years still struggling; still fighting.

You have been victims of manipulation; theft; genocide; invasion, racism; envy. (Dont let yourselfs feel like the victim; losers do that and that aint you.)

Rise above it my  brothers.

This Week At Bungie 4/25/2019,0,DestinyTheGame,2429,"Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47793

---

This week at Bungie, Saladin joins the Revelry. 


The Power-enabled combat of Iron Banner is live, and Guardians are mixing things up a bit. Wolf’s Favors, Iron Burdens, and the Reveler’s Tonic have all combined for a lively event. Whether you’re skipping grenades or hunting Iron Banner rewards, this is a week to break the rules and experiment with your loadouts. Double Valor is currently available, with Triple Valor beginning tomorrow at 10 AM PDT.


[Last week](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47781), we covered some sandbox Super tuning on its way in *Destiny 2* Update 2.2.2, planned for next month. Today, we’ll be looking at some changes currently in development for Season of Opulence, which is a bit further out. Read on to learn how the pinnacle Hand Cannons of *Destiny 2* will be changing.

##Balance the Bite



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123605/Lunas_NF_SandboxHeader.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PlcDnHD.jpg)


At the release of *Destiny 2: Forsaken*, two pinnacle weapons became available for players to earn in the Competitive playlist in the Crucible. Each weapon has a unique quest, requiring mastery of Hand Cannons to complete. There has been a lot of feedback on how the pinnacle Crucible Hand Cannons stand above most other weapons in the sandbox. Today, we’ll be going through some balance changes planned for Season of Opulence. We wanted to start this conversation early, to ensure players understood that change was coming, even if they were still on the path to acquiring these rewards. Here’s the Destiny Dev Team to walk us through the planned changes:


>
>**Dev Team:** We wanted to give you a preview of some plans we have to balance Luna’s Howl and Not Forgotten in Season of Opulence. After significant amounts of feedback, internal discussion, and playtesting, we’ve decided to adjust how these Hand Cannons work. For some players, these weapons can represent a significant investment of time and the personal improvement needed to acquire them. When tuning, we attempt to take into account the time commitment players make to acquire weapons and balance that against how those weapons affect the different game modes. 
>
>
>
>
>
>Magnificent Howl (the unique perk on these weapons) is too effective. It works in a neutral setting and rewards players for getting precision shots—something they would have done naturally. As a result, the time to kill of the game shifts to meet this new benchmark, and players feel that the majority of primary weapons in *Destiny 2* cannot compete with these pinnacle weapons. 
>
>
>
>
>
>Our current plan is to make Luna’s Howl and Not Forgotten the only 150 RPM precision Hand Cannons. They will maintain some aspects of their current behavior while taking on the firing speed and damage of the 150 RPM Hand Cannons. Magnificent Howl will also be adjusted so that it increases only body-shot damage, resulting in a two headshot/one body-shot kill. Magnificent Howl will still give an advantage due to requiring less precision hits for optimal time to kill.


Like we do whenever Destiny gameplay evolves, we’ll be watching the conversation starting today on our planned changes. We’ll continue collecting feedback once these changes go live at the beginning of Season of Opulence. If you have feedback now, please make sure to sound off on the [#Destiny2 forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&tg=Destiny2), right here on bungie.net

##Revelry: Verdant Light

Last week, Revelry Orbs were disabled in Gambit, Gambit Prime, raids, and Competitive Crucible due to an increase in GUITAR errors and activity disconnections. As multiple sources of progress for the “Verdant Light: Competitive” Triumph are no longer available, the team has been investigating a change to the requirements for completion.


As the above listed activities no longer provide progress, players are required to create 200 orbs by defeating other Guardians with precision kills in Quickplay, Rumble, and the featured Crucible playlist. This week, that playlist is Iron Banner, for example.


At this time, our current plan is to reduce this requirement to 20 orbs.


This change will be deployed after the Revelry ends, in *Destiny 2* Update 2.2.2. Players who meet the requirement of 20 orbs will have the Triumph auto-complete after downloading the patch, which will also unlock the “Party Harder” Triumph and ""Stimulant Spring"" Emblem reward if all other Revelry Triumphs have been completed.

With Season of the Drifter, new activities and weekly rituals became available to owners of the Annual Pass. Destiny Player Support has been investigating reports of various issues, and this week brings vital information regarding the Invitations of the Nine.


This is their report.


>
>**Denial of the Nine**

>Tomorrow, the seventh Invitation of the Nine will become available from Xûr. Before this pursuit goes live, we’d like to make players aware of a **blocking issu**e, which we are currently working on.

>
>
>
>Tomorrow’s invitation, titled “The Tower,” will require players to complete the Hollowed Lair strike and defeat Hive, Scorn, and Vex on the Tangled Shore. Currently, this invitation cannot be completed, since Vex are not available as enemies at any location on the Tangled Shore. This issue does not impact previous Invitations of the Nine, only ""The Tower"" invitation is currently blocked. We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

>As a reminder, each new week brings a refresh of weekly bounties to Eva Levante. Players can complete these bounties to earn powerful Inaugural Revelry gear, as well as earn progress toward the “A Bountiful Spring” Triumph. Once the Revelry concludes, all unearned and unclaimed Triumphs will be hidden, so players are encouraged to party hard while they still can.

>
>
>
>Additionally, we’d like to remind players that we’re tracking the following known issues in the Revelry:
>
>
>


* **Virescent Emblem Tracking:** We're investigating an issue where the Virescent emblem doesn't track the deepest branch reached during a single run of the Verdant Forest.
* **Revelric Light and GUITAR Errors:** To mitigate issues causing elevated GUITAR errors in *Destiny 2*, Revelric Light orb generation has been disabled in raids, Gambit, Gambit Prime, and Competitive Crucible.
* **Jubilant Engrams:** We have identified an issue where Jubilant Engrams are not knocking out items as expected when opened across multiple characters. We will be reaching out to affected players to resolve this issue after the Revelry event has ended.
* **PC Players, Bergusia Forge and Ornaments:** We're investigating an issue where PC players who wear Revelry ornaments near the Bergusia Forge experience crashing. To mitigate this issue, it's recommended to remove the Revelry ornament before going to the Forge.

We’re almost to the weekend, and I’m feeling heavy as death. Not in a bad way—truly! I’m on the grind toward the reward for 2,500 Iron Burden kills in the Iron Banner. I don’t know about you, but this is my favorite emblem in *Destiny 2*, with a badass name to boot.

I admit, the challenge is difficult. Tasking myself to fight against enemies at a 100 Power deficit is a wild ride. I’ve had to change the way I approach most engagements, but I’m getting closer and closer to my prize with each game.


Maybe I’ll see you out there. Apologies if you’re in the sights of my Arbalest.

Please nerf Esther's Limit Burst,17,FFBraveExvius,407,"This sounds very controversial but I've always wanted the game to be as balanced as possible. Personally I don't appreciate powercreep and is one of the major reasons I started to become more distant towards the game lately.

###At least this thread makes for a lot of discussion.

It's a gacha game so powercreep can't be avoided, I get that. This is a natural occurance and shouldn't shock anyone. However today we experienced the GL exclusive powercreep by ourselves. Whereas JP is pushing it to the utmost with almost every banner being limited nowadays and featuring the newest and strongest damage dealer, I thought GL would deal with it a tad better.  
Indicators for that would be for example releasing Crimson prior to Akstar. Which was a good move in my opinion.

So... they decided one week to hold back on the powercreep and re-adjust the schedule and one week later just release a unit in GL that is capable of competing with the damage dealers 9 months ahead. Which is, nicely said, questionable.

&nbsp;

#Esther Damage Output

I hope you all had the time to appreciate Cid so far. Many were shocked to see so much burst damage on one unit and with whale  gear he is capable of one-shotting every current trial through a STMR TDW build. Obviously Cid was a big step in the powercreep. GL tried to smooth the transition from our current chainers to Akstar through Crimson.

Esther's first Limit Burst is already strong but doesn't benefit from her 200% LB fillrate buff neither her 300% ATK buff. It's still a very strong LB and already stronger than Cid's burst as you can see:  

3036^2 x 3.18 x 1.3 x 31.9 x 2.4 x 2 =  6997767288  
-> 16% higher than Cid ( 6,053,928,205 )

&nbsp;

But what happens after her first LB is just... beyond me.


3306^2 x 31.9 x 4.4 x 3.814 x 2 x 1.3 = 15,212,587,691 

-> 151% higher than Cid ( 6,053,928,205 )

&nbsp;

This damage output is literally ridiculous and makes pretty much all of the coming trials that physical damage dealers work on a breeze. It's a late april fools joke to release a unit with such high parameters.


&nbsp;

#Solution?

A fitting solution in my opinion would be lowering all parameters of her LB in order to maintain its designed purpose but tune her down to match the powercreep somewhat.

**1590% Modifier + 50% DEF Ignore -> 1390% / 1290% + 50% DEF Ignore**  
**200% LB Damage buff -> 100% LB damage buff (/+ removal of the 30% LB damage passive)**  
**300% ATK buff -> 200% / 250% ATK buff**  

These changes would make fit in better into the meta and not outscale many future units in an instant, though she could likely still receive a stronger nerf.

&nbsp;

In the future we will receive units like Regina who is a lot faster than Esther but has higher drawbacks, doesn't have any of Esther's utility and brings no imperils / imbues, whereas Esther can imbue and imperil herself. The next matching chainer for Esther will be CG Bartz, who has higher burst and higher average damage, however smoothing your banners to make Akstar less of a powercreep spike to release a unit who competes with CG Bartz is a weird move and I don't approve for it.

&nbsp;

On top of it Sylvie is also a ridiculous unit who shouldn't be released the way she is now. 

If this trend continues I do not want to play or support the game anymore.


EDIT #1: Since many people accuse me for being an Akstar worshipper who doesn't want to get him de-throned: I TOTALLY AGREE that there should be more options available than Akstar. I did not support the powercreep in JP through Akstar and I didn't look forward to it in GL either, I planned to skip him.  
If Esther is better than Akstar I'd be more than happy but this is not about being better than Akstar, this is competing with JP units who are 9 months ahead.

EDIT #2 (hopefully last):  
It's not about Akstar being worse. Give me all the options that are better than Akstar, I'll gladly appreciate variety. Personally what I appreciate the most are damage dealers that don't make others outright worse but share niches that can be useful in different fights. For example Crimson having a fuck ton of Demon Killers granted him a niche that Akstar didn't have access to. This is what I think is the best design in terms of balancing.  

This post will not reflect my upcoming review, in fact it'd be not wise to NOT pull for her seeing how powerful she is. Go for her, do it!",0.51,0.0,32.0,0.0,0.0,4393.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

we don’t need to hear about every reason you stopped playing,11,Artifact,53,"these posts aren’t refreshing to hear. you’re adding nothing to the conversation that hasn’t already been said hundreds of times by different players who have quit. ENOUGH with these types of posts.

it would be different if this was a massive game with a huge player base and you’ve decided to stop playing, but it’s not. by now, if you’ve stopped playing, you’re part of the majority of players who have tried and disliked the game enough to not play it anymore.

Worst part is watching it happen in real time and seeing how naive and clueless the people being affected by this crap are.  

I've watched this happen on reddit since day one and that it still happens is seriously depressing.

All past this point is the stuff I, /u/sirmrgnome, have discovered just from like an hour of looking.

User /u/thenukadweller admitting on CringeAnarchy they are attempting a takeover. ""[r/genz will capitulate eventually unless we send in more CA divisions. r/basedgenz as a backup supply camp](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/baz9m3/i_wonder_who_is_trying_to_infiltrate_rgenz/ekfuakr/?context=3)""

User /u/litovcas1 who currently has the top post here saying ""[They are looking for mods, someone with clear background should apply. We need to have someone inside](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bbsye0/it_finally_happened_bois/eklqvdc/)""

Posts about this sub being pushed to the [top of CringeAnarchy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/baz9m3/i_wonder_who_is_trying_to_infiltrate_rgenz/) which will bring in more trolls. I mean, seriously who complains about people not wanting fascists here? The only way you get upset about that is if you are one.

Several of the current applicants for mods are in fact Cringe Anarchy regulars are very doubtful they are Gen Z.

 /u/cplKarp (a cringe anarchy and The_Donald regular) concern trolling about us not wanting the alt-right to brigade us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbvrxp/this_car_belongs_to_the_people_trying_to_stop/).

User /u/PillowDan posting a ""meme"" about 1488 which is a number related to Nazis. 14 being a dogwhistle for the saying ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children"" and 88 being alt-right slang for Heil Hitler. I also find it funny here [they are trying](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbv8n5/can_yall_be_real_for_a_fucking_minute/eklqnn4/?context=3) to convince us that Gen Z is in fact an alt-right generation.

Here's /u/freehellicopterrides (who's username is a reference to a Right-Wing South American dictator who would throw his political opposition out of helicopters) saying that ""[There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order.

We are NOT Trans Exclusionary!,32,GenderCritical,118,"This is to every TRA who calls us TERF, which is a slur, but they tell us that it means “Trans exclusionary Radical Feminists”.

Let me tell you something; **we are not excluding Transmen**! Why, because they’re female and our fight is to liberate ALL females from male supremacy. It doesn’t matter who a female is, what’s her skin color, culture, who she identifies with, whether she’s disabled, old, has four legs instead of two. It doesn’t fucking matter. 

A true feminist excludes males. I don’t want to explain feminism to anyone. It’s not my job to educate people about it. It’s your responsibility to educate yourselves. So, learn about radical feminism, which means “is a perspective within feminism that calls for a radical reordering of society in which male supremacy is eliminated in all social and economic contexts. Radical feminists view society as fundamentally a patriarchy in which men dominate and oppress women.”

Read radical feminism literature, such as  Andrea Dworkin, Mary Daly, Robin Morgan, etc.

Transwomen are males. Trans “Identified” women are males. It doesn’t really need any specific rules to identify as a trans woman, according to Transgenders, thus any man can call himself a woman. ANY.MAN! At.Any.Time! 

Feminists aren’t fighting to make men feel good about themselves, nor to FREE them from their struggles. We’re done serving men! Done! Men have no place in feminism. Therefore every true feminist, then, is male exclusionary! It doesn’t matter what a man identifies with. He can be a trans, a horse, God, we do NOT care! They can be our allies, fight with us to dismantle patriarchy, but that’s about it. Our movement doesn’t revolve around men, and our allies don’t make it about them. It’s about females! 

**So, dudes, we’re not excluding you because you’re TRANS! We’re excluding you because you’re male**. **Don't twist things! Don't spread false information! You're anti-feminists, no matter what you call yourselves!**

This release shows how me just how much of the user base did not grow up with NES,130,AnthemTheGame,336,"Tldr::: it seems as though every game that comes out (with a few exceptions)is immediately shit on for their flaws.. and it's our culture in gaming that essentially perpetuates the issue by clamoring for more games, therefore developers rush games to the public not complete  whit causes more negativity and the cycle perpetuates, the extreme negativity in gaming is going kill it or we will just continue to get half completed games. Or reskins.

Negativity in gaming has grown immensely over the last 10 years.



I just jumped into the reddit after playing for the last 2 days, and I get here to find 80% of the posts under hot as negative.

It's obvious that many people complaining do not come from the days of dragon quest, metroid etc, where all of the logging and work was done  by the player in a physical notebook. Not to mention having no idea where to go. So in comparison the bread crumbs they give you in this game are fine to me. No need for instant gratification  here.

Are load times long? Meh could be worse, I feel like Destinys are longer, do they sometimes seem to be longer then they should ( like teammate catch ups) sure, I'll give u that. But personally it's super minor.. and i play on a pretty beastly rig and have it on nvme.

But on the flipside,  the free play map feels huge and expansive.

But what grinds my gears the most about the posts on sub is the complaints about the tombs..... I mean come on people....

I played for 4 hours the first day and 4 hrs the second day. I did all items on my map before going and talking to everyone again. So 4
-5 map activities in a row. Contracts, missions etc. And absolutely no free play whatsoever.

When I got to the tomb mission I had every thing done except ultimate kills (needed 10) and chests, needed 4. So I spent 30 minutes in free play and completed the remaining tasks. ...

Come on people. Its day two. For crying out loud.

Just play the damn game. And pay attention to the specific things you need to do.



Finally, I would like to thank the devs.. I have a post on here where I was debating canceling my preorder post open demo, having played alpha, VIP and open I was very concerned for the game... but all my fears have subsided.

The flight is essentially fixed in my mind. In fact I haven't adjusted it from default. (Mouse). Swimming the same. 

The freeplay feels large, the side quests are numerous enough, and the game is visually beautiful.

I'm still a tiny bit concerned about endgame but time will tell. Regardless I have set my sights on main lining this game during the few hours I have to typically play.

Alman.

Wörter wie Kanake, Zigeuner oder Neger sind absolute No-Go's.

Würde es sich um jede andere ethnische Gruppe handeln, würde hier ein riesiger Aufschrei in den Medien erfolgen.

Aber da dies ein Begriff VON einer ethnischen Gruppe für Deutsche ist, ist natürlich alles in Ordnung.

Ridiculousness of AP supports.,17,leagueoflegends,223,"Im getting real sick of this damage that AP supports like brand and Zyra do, have you guys ever had a game where AP ""Support"" brand doesn't do most damage in the game? Laning against brand is already very hard because he outranges basically every ADC and on top of that they never run out of mana, remember when you had to carefully choose when to poke so you won't run out of mana? Well not anymore, just spam your abilities randomly and if you hit 1 or 2 out of 10 you still win because of the damage it does, no wonder ADC's are weak right now, not just because of Crit nerfs but also because mages are so strong right now. And if you say ""oh just punish him he is very squishy and weak"", yeah in soloqueue with random teammates that you have no synergy with you most likely end up killing all of your team by jumping on brand and brand pressing R and doing like 4500 damage with his ult bounces and passive + liandry.
And some people might say just don't let brand get fed but its solo queue and people trade back and forth and you know how easy it is to get kills on brand, even if brand doesnt get 10 kills he will still eventually get enough money for Liandrys because of the support gold income, almost feels like there should be 2 supports in botlane and fuck farm because supports end up having same gold anyways lol.

I feel like even if they did revert Crit changes it wouldn't change shit, ADC's would stilll be as useless as they are right now because of AP damage in the game, infinite manapool, outranging ADC's, having cc etc, ADC is just too risky role to play, you literally can't fuck up at all, one miss step and you are dead meanwhile brand gets caught and comes back with triple kill because people jump on him.
At this point i just can't handle this shit anymore. I love this game but i hate playing it.

is League going to this direction to be more appealing in Lol eSports? no wards, insane damages, time to kill so low etc?

TL;DR: Game has too much damage, infinite manapool, insane scaling per lvl (besides ADC ofc), supports have way too much gold income.

[AMA] We were jailed for 100 days and face 25 year sentences for saving refugees and asylum seekers from drowning off the coast of Greece,173,europe,624,"In 2018 an average of six people each day died attempting to cross the Mediterranean from the Middle East and Africa, according to a UNHCR report.

That’s why we (Sarah and Seán) volunteered for a search and rescue organisation based in Lesvos.

Our job was to help spot boats in distress at sea and help refugees. One of us (Sarah) knew all too well about the dangers of sea crossings, having almost sunk in a dinghy fleeing Syria in 2015.

But our mission was cut short when we were arrested by Greek authorities and spent more than 100 days in prison before being released on bail in December last year.

If the Greek court finds us guilty we could both face 25 years in prison.

Often debates with capitalists and those on the right can be quite exhausting, not because they're necessarily good at debating, but because discourse with them is often frustrating and repetitive. AntiCaps like me often have to answer to the same arguments again and again and again, even though we explain multiple times why capitalism isn't the best system.

"The Amish Don’t Get Vaccinated and They Rarely Get Autism, Cancer, or Heart Disease — Coincidence?",6,conspiracy,115,"&#x200B;

Do not talk about whether vaccines work or not, or whether or not they cause autism, unless you’re ready for a very  heated debate. Although the link between vaccines and autism is nothing new, to even speak of it can get you labeled as an “anti-vaxxer” or a  health fanatic of sorts by the sheeple (brainwashed masses) that believe every vaccine the CDC recommends not only works, but is 100% safe and 100% effective 100% of the time. Even if some vaccines work some of the  time, are they worth the health risk? That is the ultimate question, because one statistic you may not know is that children who receive [mercury-containing vaccinations](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.healing-arts.org/children/mercury_in_vaccines_autism_research/thimerosalinvaccinationslink.htm) (listed as thimerosal usually) are [27 times more likely](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://traceamounts.com/ten-lies-told-about-mercury-in-vaccines/) to develop [autism](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.truthwiki.org/autism-asperger-syndrome-asd/) than those who don’t get those jabs. That comes from a recent study  based on the CDC’s own data. Still want to keep it a hush-hush topic?

Pediatricians in America are not allowed to question vaccines at all, nor are they allowed to recommend less than the CDC recommends, or they face the wrath of the AMA – the infamous American Medical Association –  that finds a way to shut down the “contenders,” sometimes even taking away their license to practice medicine. Big question: would the statistics of autism suddenly bottom out if mercury was removed from all vaccines, including flu shots? (By the way, the CDC lied when they said  mercury has been removed from all vaccines).

**Nary is a case of autism in the Amish communities of America**

For starters, children are not born with autism. It appears during infancy or childhood, and is brought on by an overload of neurotoxins either consumed, injected or ingested from environmental factors, or all of the above. In fact, the recent autism spectrum disorder (ASD) spike over the past two decades in the USA directly coincides with the vaccine schedule increase, by quantity and frequency, enforced by the CDC. To understand why autism is next to non-existent for the Amish, consider  that the Amish have been “cut off” from American scientific and medical “progress” for centuries, thus they’ve had less exposure to the major factors that trigger autism, including the most likely  proponent–vaccines.

Take a little trip to the heart of [Pennsylvania Dutch country](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://yournewswire.com/why-dont-amish-children-get-autism/) and try to tag yourself even half a dozen Amish children with autism and you’ll come up short. **If statistics matched our national average, there would be about 200 in the Amish community, but to date, there are only three, one of which was adopted and brought over from China.** Go figure. Another one actually did get vaccinated and developed autism shortly afterwards. Go figure again.

Here are some universal and national statistics to consider. Autism affects over 20 million people around the world, and occurs in boys four to five times more often than girls. In the US, one in every 68 children has some form of ASD, a 30% increase from just 2012. Why is that, you’re asking yourself? United States kids get 50 inoculations before age seven, many that are combinations containing multiple disease strains, mercury, formaldehyde (yes, embalming fluid for the dead), monosodium glutamate (MSG) and aluminum, just to name a few neurotoxins. Flu shots contain the highest levels of mercury, up to 25,000 times  what the EPA allows as a maximum in drinking water and edible fish.  Mercury is the second most poisonous element know to mankind.

**Due to religious beliefs, the Amish opt out of all vaccines**

Fortunately for the Amish, they’re also opting out of three of the most controversial vaccines on the market today: hepatitis B, HPV (human  papillomavirus) and of course, the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella combo)  that was implicated in the [CDC vaccine-autism-link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.truthwiki.org/dr-william-thompson/) and biggest medical cover-up in history, ever. Conflicting with CDC claims, the multi-dose version of hepatitis B still contains thimerosal  (50% mercury). The immature central nervous systems and the liver of Amish newborns are spared this volatile toxin thanks to their parent’s religious beliefs. [Amish children ](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://12160.info/m/discussion?id=2649739%3ATopic%3A1536735)experience hardly any learning disabilities at all, in fact. Nor are the Amish experiencing typical US diseases like cancer, heart disease and  diabetes. This could all be because they [don’t eat GMO](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/https://truthkings.com/amish-people-hardly-ever-get-cancer/), take chemical pharmaceuticals, or vaccines. Surely, no government run  regulatory agency will ever run this comparison of Amish health vs. non-Amish health, but the reality speaks for itself.

Still, the [CDC refuses to regulate](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.cdc.news/) the vaccine industry and instead literally promotes toxic chemicals, dangerous heavy metal toxins, carcinogens and lethal “preservatives” like mercury. It’s all about [lifestyle and natural health](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/https://www.healthrangerstore.com/pages/search-results?q=natural%20health&disable_semantics=1) these days, if you really want immunity that doesn’t come with a boatload of permanent and debilitating “side effects,” like autism spectrum disorder, Asperger’s syndrome or liver cancer.

(Spoilers Extended) GRRM’s ending will fail just like the show if…,3,asoiaf,284,"…he does not scrap King Bran. All the criticism of the show’s ending about how King Bran was not set up properly and came out of the blue is valid for the 5 published books so far.

In the show, Bran missed a season. In the published books, GRRM could not write more than 3 Bran chapters in the last 20 years. These 3 chapters in ADwD and the previous 4 chapters in ASoS are mostly travelogue. Bran is barely present in the overall story and he is one of the least connected POVs. GRRM is clearly having a problem with Bran’s POV as he confessed several times.

I always use the titles “Game” and “Song” to explain ASOIAF. Game is the political side of the story and Song sums up the magical aspect. Since the beginning of the story, the basic question about Game is presented as “Who will rule Westeros in the end?” As for the Song, the corresponding question is “How will the Others be defeated?” Both the Game and the Song will need to be resolved to conclude ASOIAF satisfactorily.

Bran has only been involved with the Song. There is no Game in Bran’s trajectory so far. Bran is the Last Hero-equivalent of the story, doing magic things to save the world and possibly remain anonymous just the same. By GRRM’s philosophy, greenseers can only have brief regular lives, after which they leave the realm of the mortals and merge with the weirnet. Bran is the Frodo of ASOIAF, not its Aragorn. It is ridiculous to claim otherwise. Magic is dangerous per GRRM. Bran is playing with fire. Just like Frodo, Bran should end up permanently broken by magic. The trajectory of Bran’s story in the books is the complete opposite of a ruling position.

As for the Aragorn of ASOIAF, look no further than Jon. The 5 books are full of setup for King Jon. Although Jon’s story seems to be about the Song at the surface level, Jon is being fed learning to lead arc for most of the way. There is a lot of leader and father figures Jon met on the way and took some lessons from them to heart. With the upcoming introduction of RLJ, Jon will be positioned at the heart of both the Game and the Song. The problem of ruling will not be decided without taking Jon’s claim into account. The Others will not be defeated without Jon playing a big part per prophecies and also per the narrative investment in the books. The massive setup for RLJ and Jon’s learning to lead arc require a natural culmination that he should be the ruler in the end. I am not even talking about mountains of carefully planted foreshadowing quotes for King Jon.

A lot of readers deceive themselves by believing that the failure with the show’s finale lies with the execution and not the ending. King Bran is not one of those cases. There is no reasonable way to execute King Bran with the source material we have. How do you expect D&D to set up King Bran which GRRM could not do in 5 books?

To conclude, the setup and the direction of the 5 published books do not match with the King Bran ending in GRRM’s mind. No one can deny that. Even the most ardent defenders of King Bran failed to see it coming before the Season 8 leaks. Post history does not lie! Either GRRM will follow the natural flow and the organic growth of the story at hand or there will be a sharp twist at the end with the readers suddenly hitting a massive Wall.",0.51,0.0,66.0,-0.5,0.29999999999999993,3292.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"No, it's not ""pay to win"".",6,fo76,102,"Listen... if a thing can be bought with currency earned in-game, it's not pay to win, full stop.

This term has been twisted and diluted over the last few years to such a crazy point it's almost funny. Pay to win is when items that give a distinct advantage over other players can only be obtained EXCLUSIVELY by paying actual money.

You can't swing a dead 3 headed opossum without hitting a workbench in this game, so there is no distinct advantage in that way, beyond the fact that apparently the even better ones will be dropping from events in-game for free.

What these repair kits represent are, at worst, pay to be lazy or pay to bypass.

THAT BEING SAID.

What we SHOULD worry about is the cost of them in Atoms. Cuz if it's like 10-70 Atoms, no big deal, that's a few daily challenges or a weekly.

If they are hundreds or thousands of Atoms, yeah, that's a problem, because it's heavy handedly encouraging money without demanding it... but even then, not pay to win.

I just... I get so tired of people using the term wrong and spreading misinformation.

Now, go ahead and down vote me to oblivion, but I'll still be right.

Edit: WHELP, I'm willing to admit some wrong, here. The definition of p2w has changed and become much more fluid than I realized, and what once seemed to be set in stone has become more of an opinion thing, and I guess I'm completely behind on this. To me, it will always represent a mechanic where somebody MUST pay real cash to obtain items that give distinct, obvious functional advantage over others and cannot be obtained through in-game means in any way, but apparently that's only one version of how it's viewed.

So I'll eat like... half a crow happily. I cannot state with the assured tone I did that it means any one thing. I guess I'm an old man shaking a fist at clouds, now...fuck.",0.51,0.0,26.0,0.8,0.4,1830.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

>“At least I’m not trying to cage children at the border and inject them with drugs,” she said. “That’s not a mistake. That is a deliberate policy to attack people based on their national origin. That’s not a mistake, that’s just hatred. That’s just cruelty. That’s just wrong!”

>She made the comment after she complained about the frequent criticism she faces for gaffes as a 29-year-old Congresswoman.

Every Church near me seems to pander to the LGBT,40,TrueChristian,610,"Edit: For everybody who comes to this from Subreddits with intentions to brigade, I want you to know my wish is not to have LGBT excluded from the church I go to. I just as a Christian, want to know that the Church I'm going to doesn't lie to them or me about what we're getting into. You're not in this world, so you don't realize that there are people who lie about what the Bible says. We as Christians believe EVERYTHING in the Bible is true, including people who identify as gay. 

Because we believe, I, and yes even LGBT Christians think it's important that if a Church is openly inviting LGBT people in, that they don't lie to them. On this sub there are many LGBT Christians who believe that acting on their desires is a sin, and they are fine with that and have given it up for their beliefs.

If you think that's ridiculous, whatever, they chose to do so because we believe God is real and we believe what the Bible tells us we have to do.

I don't say this because I'm worried about you liking me. I'm posting this because my wording came off wrong to many, and it reopened wounds of people who mean what they think I mean. It breaks my heart that I unintentionally came off as one of those so-called Christians who didn't tell them these things out of love, but out of vitriol.

Know that I have no vitriol towards any of you. On the contrary I love every single one of you. Yes even you, antifa member fantasizing about punching me. But also know, part of love is honesty even when somebody doesn't want to hear it. If a LGBT member wants to give their life to Jesus, they have to know what they means. 

I get that it's crazy to you. I was with you once. But things in my life brought me to God and because of that I have no doubt in my mind that he's not only real, but that he means what he said in the Bible. And again I want to let you know there are LGBT people who agree with me. 

If you've been hurt by fake Christians who attacked who you are with hatred, just keep these coming 8 words in mind. There is no place in Heaven for them (unless they genuinely repent and change their ways). They bring shame to Jesus and when they meet him on judgement day, his words are going to be ""depart from me, I never knew you. Workers of lawlessness.""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a dilemma I'm going through right now.  They either show the rainbow flag on their website, or have a statement where they sneak in that they're ""accepting of all sexualities"". I wanted to try out a Lutheran Church but every single one seems to have these implications. Which is ironic, Luther's whole creation of this Church was based on scriptures, they're basically spitting on his grave. 

Now there are some where I can't tell if that's what they're implying, but when they use words like ""accepting"" it leaves me unsure about what they mean within this climate. 

Now I have no hatred for LGBT people. I don't even feel comfortable about the subject because I had a different opinion before I found God, and it's something I'm still reconciling with. The thing is that doesn't matter, I only want a church that doesn't contradict what the scriptures say. 

What kind of description should I look out for in a Church? Is it necessarily bad that they say they're ""accepting"" or is that an LGBT dog whistle? I really want a place for me and my mother to go to for community but it's so cloudy here I almost just want to build my own church... Only half kidding lol. 

I'm in the Hartford region in Connecticut in case you know Churches in this area I can go to.

Edit: I'm going to post this here because it gets tiring rewording the same think the literal word ""acceptance"" is the problem. I apologize if I came off that way but that's not my intent. I do want all sinners ""accepted"", but I don't want sinners lied to. Both false teachers and good teachers claim acceptance, and when they don't clarify whether or not they're accepting the sin or the sinner; for my spiritually safety I have to assume the worst.

 If they're not telling LGBT people that the bible forbids acting on homosexuality, that's worldy acceptance but not Godly acceptance. Just like I wouldn't want to go to church and be told my old prideful desire for fame is okay, I don't want Gay people who genuinely want to know to be told that God allows them to marry and have sexual relations. 

My issue with the word ""accepting"" is that it's so vague. Joel Osteen could say he's accepting, but an actual good teacher can too.",0.54,0.0,48.0,0.1,0.4,4511.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

lyrics, with sources:

When you go and pick a POTUS

and he's clinically bogus

who are you gonna call?

Robert Mueller!

Mueller's the man, he's the man with the plan

ain't nobody better do you understand?

my heart is full for Mr. Mueller

he's comin' for the comrades it's clear

that everybody's working for Vladimir

Come on Mr. Mueller won't you tell me please

I'm tired of waiting I'm down on my knees

I don't need to read no history

McCarthy? Who's he?

Just blame it all on the Ruskies!

Mueller's wifey's family's got some pedigree

her uncle was [given the boot](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3713644/posts) by Kennedy

and his brother was mayor

in [Dallas that day](http://themillenniumreport.com/2019/02/deep-state-agent-robert-mueller-is-even-connected-to-the-jfk-assassination-via-his-wifes-family/)

and when [Pan Am 103](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103_bombing_investigation) in Lockerbie

eliminated [operative Charles McKee](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,159523,00.html)

in comes Mueller

the [damage controller](http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2006/07/342787.shtml)

see the [CIA traffics in arms and drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair)

so they told Mueller to [scapegoat some Noriegas](https://www.liberationnews.org/robert-mueller-prosecutor-poor-defender-rich/)

for the cocaine nation

of their own creation

the Cold, Cold War might be no more

but I'll tell you exactly what I'm waiting for:

Come on Mr. Mueller won't you tell me please

I'm tired of waiting I'm down on my knees

I don't need to read no history

McCarthy? Who's he?

Just blame it on the Ruskies!

Who needs the punishment to fit the crime when it's Mueller Time?

In the 80's the shady [BCCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International)

was launderin' and squanderin' for a couple bad guys

so [poppy Bushy said](https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/12/05/criminal-history-bcci-the-bushes-and-mueller/) ""Better call Mueller!""

well AG Mueller was on the case 

and made positively sure the [coverup was in place](https://www.blacklistednews.com/FBI_Director_Mueller_was_at_center_of_alleged_BCCI_coverup_in_1991/4304/0/20/20/Y/M.html)

while the Department of Justice

said ""Just trust us!""

they made him [convict four innocent men of murder](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/10/mueller-connected-boston-mobster-whitey-bulger-killed-in-prison-as-he-was-about-to-out-fbi-officials/)

to cover for [FBI informant Whitey Bulger](https://washingtonbabylon.com/whitey-bulger-and-the-fbi-what-did-robert-mueller-know-and-when-did-he-know-it/)

hey look! Whitey went nighty, nighty!

a skeleton or two out of the way

he can spend all his time on peepee dossiers

Come on Mr. Mueller won't you tell me please

I'm tired of waiting I'm down on my knees

I don't need to read no history

McCarthy? Who's he?

Just blame it on the Ruskies!

Who needs the punishment to fit the crime when it's Mueller Time?

He was a [douche to LaRouche](https://www.larouchepac.com/20170927/robert-mueller-amoral-legal-assassin-he-will-do-his-job-if-you-let-him) and in Ruby Ridge,

Waco, and Oklahoma [he hid evidence](https://www.opdeepstate.com/2017/06/01/fbi-director-nominee-mueller-helped-fbi-and-doj-cover-up-evidence-on-waco-ruby-ridge-okc-bombing/)

and when Congress requested

[Mueller protested](http://www.intellectualconservative.com/the-mueller-show-trial/)

he served and earned his title head of FBI

and began [1 week](https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/06/21/good-agent-bad-agent-robert-mueller-and-9-11/) before [3 towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center) fell from the sky

and while [Mueller was prancing](https://newspunch.com/fbi-robert-mueller-911/)

some [Israelis were dancing](https://www.corbettreport.com/911-suspects-dancing-israelis/)

he [helped hide the hijackers Saudi ties](https://theblacksphere.net/2018/12/guess-who-led-the-fbi-cover-up-of-saudi-9-11-hijackers)

and [supported endless war](https://21stcenturywire.com/2017/10/29/lest-forget-independent-mueller-part-establishment-helped-sell-iraq-war/) and torture what a surprise

an [ideal agent](http://conservativefighters.com/news/robert-muellers-three-outrageous-scandals-revealed/) in an age of surveillance

and now you know that Mueller's fuller of air that facts

he was happy to [pin a patsy](http://thefederalist.com/2018/02/08/robert-mueller-botching-investigations-since-anthrax-attacks/) to [clean up the anthrax](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/05/21/when_comey_and_mueller_bungled_the_anthrax_case_133953.html)

and that [Patriot Act](https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/371206-robert-muellers-forgotten-surveillance-crime-spree)

thank Mueller for that

he's instigated and [infiltrated](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/10/washington/10fbi.html) political foes

while harassing the masses daring to question the status quo

I just thought you should know

it's all part of the show

Come on Mr. Mueller won't you tell me please

I'm tired of waiting I'm down on my knees

I don't need to read no history

McCarthy? Who's he?

Just blame it on the Ruskies!

Come on Mr. Mueller tell me please

I'm tired of waiting I'm down on my knees

I got a D in high school history

"PSA: Yes, there's server lag in big PvP battles. No, you have no idea what you're talking about.",5,classicwow,82,"* **Argument:** the servers are lagging. Blizzard isn't updating their servers because they don't care.
   * How much RAM or processing power on a server isn't the only thing that affects lag/latency. You can't just throw more resources at the problem. What else affects this?
      * Code: this is an old version of WoW. It might not be as optimized, parallelized, or bug-free.
      * Bandwidth: limited by their internet service provider(s). If their network is too congested, they can't just call their ISP and make them fix it.
* **Argument:** some other private server was able to handle much more than these servers. Blizzard is either incompetent or doesn't care.
   * Did those servers have monitoring, logging, and analytics? Storage and database redundancy? Cyber attack protection? Backend processes for GM support, AH, and instances to prevent lock outs?
   * What would you rather have? Less lag for 200 vs 200 world PvP battles? Or one of these issues:
      * Server crashing
      * Character getting corrupted/lost
      * GMs unable to help you when some character-breaking bug occurs
      * The AH sporadically not working
      * Being unable to join instances/raids because they're ""full""
      * Being unable to log in for extended periods of time
      * Maintenance taking multiple days instead of a few hour
* **Argument:** they have the resources to fix this stuff, they just don't care.
   * How would you know? You know people in their engineering and DevOps department that have tons of free time? Blizzard just has tons of spare employees not working on anything else that they can throw at a problem because 1% of the subscription population can't do huge world PvP battles?

I am not saying they shouldn't attempt to improve the situation. What I am saying is that it's not as easy as you people think it is. If you think that you know what you're talking about, go apply at Blizzard and fix it. No? Then shut the fuck up.  


**Edit:** I don't mean to say that people shouldn't complain. You should. That's one of the great advantages of an online community like this. But you need to change your expectations.

"Girlfriend Calls Ex Every Night, Very Uncomfortable With It",0,relationship_advice,150,"Before my girlfriend and I started dating, she had a boyfriend of 5 years. Lately whenever I fall asleep, she goes to call her ex. It's making me really uncomfortable.

I don't mind my girlfriend being friends with her ex. I don't like being the controlling type so I let her be friends with whoever. But how close they are really puts me off. I know they don't like each other, but every night when I go to sleep she leaves the call and goes straight to her ex. Usually they call all night until they fall asleep, usually sleeping on call. That's likely an accident but that still makes me uncomfortable. 

I've expressed how I feel about this before, and she does feel bad about it. She knows I get jealous over it but I still let her do it simply because she doesn't like being alone and has no one else to go to. I understand the reason, but still knowing that every time I fall asleep she's gonna call her ex for the whole night makes me really uncomfortable.

I'm not really sure what to do. I don't like this but at the same time I don't wanna stop her because she could get lonely at night and that might not end well. If you guys have any advice I'm willing to hear it 💙

TL:DR - Girlfriend calls ex of 5 years every night I go to sleep because she doesn't like being alone and has no one else to go to. I understand why but it still makes me uncomfortable.

EDIT: I'm talking about this with her right now. She states that he's the only other person she can trust which.. Isn't true. She has other friends. But she said she'll try and stop for me. I know I seem dumb to a lot of people right now and you know what, maybe I am. Maybe I'm dumb for staying in this relationship for so long. But I can't help myself. I've become so attached to this girl that I do wanna make it work. Things have slowly gotten better for the past few days and I'm still trying to tie some loose ends. I appreciate everyone's concern and I'm sorry if I seem very unintelligent.",0.5,0.0,59.0,-0.65,1.0,1965.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
If Valve made Artifact in 2013...,40,Artifact,233,"* Game would either be 100% free to play, or $15 entry fee.

* All cards would be free for the player to use (this includes and new card sets added in the future), create decks and experiment with. The idea would be to put everyone on an equal playing field where the player has all the tools available to them.

* All modes would be available for the player to play for free. Ranked mode released post-launch for free.

* Purchasable card packs would be available for each released set that include several rarities of cosmetic changes to the cards. Ranging from rare cards that make subtle changes to the card such a shiny border, to legendary cards that feature fully animated cards.

* An actual healthy marketplace economy.

* Being able to *actually* trade these cosmetic/holographic cards with your friends.

* Seasonal Events with timed special events earning unique rewards. As well as seasonal cosmetics to purchase.

"Dear Community, We Care! 🙇",0,ClashRoyale,1071,"Hey Reddit,

This is gonna be a long one… 😅

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/a4moah/dear_supercell_we_get_it_you_dont_care_about/) has gained a lot of traction and we thought we should address it, but just wanted to get something out in the open - as there is a lot of misinformation in the opening paragraphs. Sure, it my sound defensive but it's not coming from an argumentative place. To hear that we don't care about our own game is just simply untrue, and we just wanted to clear some things up. So here we go…

The only people who have the final say to what goes into the game is the game team. We (The Clash Royale game team) have the final say on everything that goes into Clash Royale. We are the ones that make all the decisions.

There is no external pressure 'forcing' us to do stuff - there's no *'1 or 2 people at the top of the food chain'* in charge of us, or members of the game team *'who are like WTF in their minds right now'* due to stuff beyond our control - we are the ones in control! Yes, we take influence from our coworkers in Supercell as well as the community and our content creators, but any decisions (good or bad) are our own and we take a massive amount of pride in this (if you'd like to know a bit more about how we work, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/X7MRK0R0qAU), or [this one](https://youtu.be/1ZtlyZOGqAg) or [this article](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-05-04-supercell-meet-the-worlds-least-powerful-ceo)).

This is awesome for lots of reasons (such as when we changed the donate stuff the other day - we didn't need to jump through any hoops or get it signed off - we just did it), but it also puts the responsibility entirely on us. If we mess up, we mess up. We own it and try to learn from it.

We are all passionate gamers and having our own game that has a bunch of players is one of the best feelings. When we release something that players aren't happy with - that is the worst feeling! We care about our game *and* all of you!

First and foremost, we want to make an amazing game that players will love and play for years. Everything else is secondary, and fortunately we are in a company that allows us to have this freedom. Supercell is founded on the belief that game teams should make the best games, and not have to worry about all the other stuff.

I know that the explanation of how Supercell works makes a lot of OP's assumptions and points incorrect, but obviously there was a reason for these conclusions to be made and that's something we have been discussing as a team. So, onto some other topics!

Looking through the sub these past few days it's clear that there are two things on people's minds - TRADE TOKENS and to a lesser extent, the f2p experience.

**The F2P Experience**

The Global Tournament we added allows players to get free rewards from it. Simply by playing the Global Tournament you earn free rewards (the catch is, you gotta be good 😉).

By making the Global Tournament free to enter, those players who have the skills to win a Grand Challenge, but perhaps didn't have the Gems, can play for free and if they decide the Bonus Rewards are worth it, they can get them afterwards. If not, no worries, they still got to play competitively and get some decent rewards without paying an entry fee!

The Bonus Rewards that cost Gems are really great value for what they are, but require you to up your game and win to earn them. If you don't want to buy a Chest, these Bonus Rewards allow you the chance to get a bunch of stuff that would normally cost you a lot more Gems. For example, if you got 7 wins in the first Global Tournament, buying the reward would have given you better value than a straight up Legendary Chest from the Shop.

We also boosted the rewards you get from Clan Wars by more than doubling the amount of Trade Tokens and adding the ability to get up to 50 Gems, as well as increasing the amount of Bonus Gold you get (as it is now less frequently awarded, due to the inclusion of Gems & Trade Tokens). We also added some festive, Clashmas ‘advent style’ Daily Quests throughout the month of December, which give a lot of stuff to f2p players if they complete them!

**Trade Tokens!**

The BIG one. What I can say first and foremost is that we won't be changing the fact that both players need a Trade Token, at least not so soon after implementing it. Yes, there will be less Trades at the start whilst the economy acclimatises, but we believe it will level out over time.

One issue that we are looking into is the fact that people are treating these Trades like they were before the update. Putting out a Trade, and hoping someone takes it.

With the new system, people are still putting out Trades that they want, but not what other people want. We believe that with a bit more communication, alongside the increased chance of getting Trade Tokens, this will resolve those issues.

One thing that we are looking to change however is the UI, and how Trades are displayed in-game. Some ideas we have been throwing around (and that the community has come up with also) are maybe adding a 'Trading tab', or changing it so that Trades have a timer on them. If we would have done this before the update, we think it would have gone a lot smoother than it did.

/end long reddit post

Thanks again for posting here and giving us the opportunity to clear some stuff up with regards to the development of the game, and a platform to discuss the changes. As said above, the game team are the only people who have the final say on what goes into your game. So please continue to talk to **us** and give **us** your feedback.

We were all talking about this post this morning… which is a good thing! We are the ones who can make the changes that you want to see. If we aren't making changes for whatever reason, we will let you know why.

Cheers, and thanks for getting this far!

"Cancelling all student debt is a horrible idea, and American taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook to payoff someone's poor financial decisions",91,unpopularopinion,356,"I'm honestly sick of hearing how this is a great idea and how it'll boost the economy.  These students made poor financial decisions early in their lives, by taking out large loans when they never even had a plan on how to re-pay or even what the ROI would be on their education.  Cancelling this debt is completely unfair to a large majority of American taxpayers.  I get it - you think this means ""I didn't get it, so neither should you"" but that's not what it is at all.

Financially responsible students and alumni planned, adjusted, and changed their lives and aspirations based on the financials of going to college, what they could actually afford, and how to pay down student loans when they left.  You also had people who wanted to go to college, had the skills, knowledge, and ambition to learn but couldn't afford tuition, so they ended up not going to college, going the military, trades, etc.  At the same time, we had irresponsible students signing away their lives to expensive schools, who had no means of being able to pay back these loans - and here we are talking about giving these irresponsible students a gift of a lifetime at the expense of taxpayers?

What about the others - the ones who were responsible, chose a state school instead of a prestigious private school, worked multiple jobs while studying, commuted instead of living in a dorm, or decided to go into the trades instead?  They paid their dues, worked for what they received and to get to where they are.  Its not fair to ask the people in those groups to pay AGAIN for YOUR education.  Me paying twice, and you not paying anything is definitely not something I would ever support.

You know what I hear a lot too - ""i would definitely be buying more things if I had that extra $500-1000/month instead of my student loan payments"" ... my dude, YOU ALREADY SPENT THAT MONEY ON YOUR EDUCATION.",0.6,0.0,140.0,-0.35,0.4,1879.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I think the overall reaction to this hero release reflects how negative the community of this game really is,48,heroesofthestorm,194,"I get it, another Nexus hero that has a not-so-original kit, which could have been a good opportunity to do some fan-service by adding Deathwing, and instead of Kevin announcing the hero we only get some hero-quotes... Yes, things could have been better, but you guys seem to forget that this is new content, the new hero looks cool as hell, the animations look whack, and frankly, I am looking forward to seeing a new hero refresh my games a little.

The last year has been pretty rough on HOTS, and players seem to still carry the pain of the HGC cancellation, the maintenance mode, the ""don't you guys have phone"", the layoffs. Let bygones be bygones. If you can't get over it, find a game that makes you happy and do better things than spreading hate. 

Blizzard may or may not care so much about the game, but there's still a group of developers and animators that comment here weekly if not daily, and they're trying to keep the game running. If they're gonna take crap from the community, they'll take even more crap from Blizzard, which to be honest, doesn't sound fair to me.

An open letter from the mod team,0,apexlegends,1218,"Hey everyone,

Recently we’ve seen a lot of controversy over our post removals, rules, and the mod team. Our subreddit has been around for about a month, growing to over 630,000 subscribers and millions of visitors per day - This has not been easy for us. With the thousands of reports we get daily, mistakes are bound to happen. We remove over a thousand posts a day based on user reports and automoderator flags. Our all-volunteer team does their best to make sure that everything we remove is sound and in line with our rules, but as I said before, mistakes happen. Of course, this is no excuse for removing something for the wrong reason or at times, no reason at all. Moving forward, we are reflecting and working on a plan to approach these issues in the future.

Due to our subreddit still being in its infancy, our rules are fluid and a work in progress - we know they are not perfect! A select team of mods will focus on writing, editing, and restructuring our rules to be consistent and fair to promote content that provides constructive discussion.

One of our main goals is keeping everything in line with Reddit rules and policies, such as [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). One such requirement is to avoid witch hunting, which is done quickly on posts reporting users for cheating, cursing, teaming, etc. Due to this being a Reddit policy, we are forced to enforce it with our best judgment. We understand the criticism regarding our stance on cheating posts, but they create an unhealthy environment as evidenced in posts we've seen over the past few days. Reporting these offenses to official platforms that can handle your request (EAC, EA support) and have the ability to take action is more likely to provide a result.

As we have stated before, **no moderator executes an action on behalf of Respawn, EA, or any third party.** We are an all-volunteer force of people who took these positions because we share the same passion for this game as you do. As moderators, one of our primary goals is keeping Reddit free of one-sided topics (echo chambers) and geared toward constructive discussion, positive or negative. Every moderating decision is made by us and not influenced by anyone outside of our team. Does that mean every decision we make is the best one ever? No. We make mistakes because we are human and with such a large community, mistakes are bound to happen. We are always learning how to go about certain things, such as approving a 3rd party giveaway or the removal of a controversial post. All major decisions are voted on by the entire moderation team, ranging from a simple rewording of rules to the approval of a giveaway from a 3rd party (take Razer for example). If you want to learn more about how we work as a team, feel free to message us via modmail or reach out to me (or any other mod) via DM on Discord or Reddit. We don’t want it to look like what we do is influenced by any hidden party and will do whatever it takes to be transparent. We all love this game and want to see nothing but the best for Apex, but most importantly, its community. None of us would be here if we didn’t want to see /r/ApexLegends be the best place to go for Apex Legends. However, we can’t do this without you - The community is what makes this place truly special.

The entire team is open to hearing what you think on our rules, removal policies and the group itself. If you are interested, we are happy to host a moderator AMA. There you can pick our brains about operations and what it’s like building one of the largest subreddits most of us have ever volunteered to run. 

Our primary discussion focus here is reviewing our rules to avoid future confusion and issues, but we can still discuss recent events. Please keep your responses constructive and free of hate, as we want this discussion to be as fluid and helpful to all sides as possible. 

---

**Update:** TalTallon has decided it would be best for the community if he stepped down. We will miss his company and are eternally thankful for the work he did to create this subreddit and discord. No matter what your opinion may be on him, please don't let that overshadow the work he's done to make sure that you have a place to talk about Apex. As mentioned above, we will continue to work on our rules and policies and are open to any constructive feedback you may have.

Unpopular opinion: There is nothing wrong with reserves.,9,classicwow,215,"All the time, both around here and ingame, I see people crying and whining about reserves. If you don't like someone's reserve, don't join that group. What's the problem? What's stopping you from making your own group with no reserves? It's just pointless whining and shitposting about how other people run their groups.

I personally tank DM East jump runs with the Thorium veins reserved, and have had people whine at me for being ""greedy"". Uh...no, there's literally nothing in there that I need except the thorium veins. I'm putting together a group, tanking a dungeon that I don't need any gear from, and allowing other people to get their preraid gear in exchange for the thorium veins at the end. What's so ""greedy"" about that? You can't even get the thorium veins unless you're a Miner anyway.

When it comes to people reserving gear, again, what is stopping you from just making your own group? Typically the things on reserve are very low droprate items, like Ironfoe, or HoJ, or dal'rends. People don't want to run the instance 30+ times, finally have it drop, and then lose the roll. It's not ""greedy"" or ""elitist"" or ""entitled"" to not want your time wasted.

Another example from me, I tanked Arena/Angerforge farm groups with HoJ reserved. The DPS ended up being Mage/Warlock and a Warrior who already had HoJ. No complains, run went smooth, mage got his spell hit sash and I got my HoJ after 4 runs.

By announcing a reserve up-front, you're making the loot rules completely clear so that people know what they're getting into. Would you rather people just not say anything, and then suddenly change the loot to master looter before the boss dies and take the item you thought you were going to roll on? No, that'd be horrible.

Anyone else really tired of people whining about bags and bugs?,6,fo76,146,"Is the game perfect? No far from it but all the bandwagon negative posts are ridiculous. 

Let's be real 

If you bought the 200 dollar plastic helmet and you are mad about the 5 dollar bag, vs the 10 dollar bag they advertised you are a moron. 

To all the ""game experts"" trashing fo76 reviews for clickbate articles, a small child could do your job and many do it better. 

bugs are bugs, they are in every game at launch and to pretend otherwise is completely dishonest.  Furthermore, complaining about ""all the bugs"" is just going to kill a game that could be amazing and for your own profit, you should be ashamed. go make a cutting edge, never done before game and see how perfect your launch is.  if you don't think it's in a playable state then go play fortnight, since everyone is up their butt anyways.

Bethesda is pushing the envelope here and not making the exact same game 50 times, cough* assassin's Creed cough*. So cut them some slack and stop trashing something that will take time to perfect but has more potential than anything in years.

I have played 30 plus hours and yeah there are bugs, I report the bugs or discuss them here but I don't whine and trash the game, and demand responses and refunds and make everything into some huge deal, it's a video game people, you aren't owed anything from Bethesda. You bought their game if you don't like it don't play it or wait until mod support and then change what you don't like. Acting like a bunch of entitled jackasses is only going to ruin a game that is quite frankly very good and fun to play. 

Sorry for the rant but this is stupid, a vocal minoritiy of broken people and game journalist who are just out for blood soaked headlines and easy cash are going to ruin a game they have no intention of playing in 2 months. 

 if you expect a 100% perfect game that is also ground breaking and the first of it's kind, then once again you are a moron. 

Bethesda  made a game and they are working on fixes and taking suggestions, what more do you want? They are not going to make you a game personally. Beyond that I don't understand what would make these entitled children stop whining but I hope Bethesda knows that plenty of us really enjoy fo76 and will continue to be patient while they make fixes and add content.

"There is ZERO benefit to having a crush. Eliminate your feelings/attraction towards them. You can subtly give them signals, but don't pursue or idealize them.",0,FemaleDatingStrategy,36,"I've been there before. I used to be the kind of girl who would get crushes on men and it would turn a bit obsessive. I would fantasize about how good being with them would feel and I did things to make them aware of my existence. I initiated contact, I led our interaction, and I was forward with my seduction. I had a stronger masculine personality back then and I didn't mind taking the lead. I wanted to make them like me. Of course, it didn't work out. It only made the man emotionally unavailable and I think I was attracted to a man's emotional unavailability because I didn't have enough self-worth back then. I just didn't know any better.

Now I see some posts here where basically the OP is asking what moves she should make to catch the attention of her crush. She knows about his existence and admires him, but he doesn't know her. Or... she's friends with her crush and she wants to take it to the next level. I know that pleasure that comes from yearning for someone and the thrill of the unknown. ""Does he or does he not like me? I want him to notice me. I want to make him mine."" It's a drug, chasing after men; it makes you feel more alive. But oh, how our emotions mislead us! Allowing yourself to get carried away will bring nothing but pain.

My advice basically is... do not have a crush on anyone ever. If you ever feel yourself liking a friend, stop feeling that way, because if he's interested in you, he would have asked you out already. If it's a stranger that you like, stop feeling that way, because liking someone who hasn't noticed you is a sure way to put you in pursuit mode and FDS women don't pursue. And remember, if you were his type, he would have noticed you already. You want a man that notices you. Sure, you can flirt with your friend or make flirty eye contact with the cute stranger, but stop yourself from feeling intense emotions and infatuation towards them. Only entertain men who pursue you HARD. Plus, once a man finds out you have a crush on him before he decides that he likes you, he’ll have the power in the relationship and will take you for granted subconsciously. 

The best course of action is to become your best self and attract men to your life, while at the same time not letting yourself have a silent crush on anyone EVER. You only entertain men who obviously pursue you and you don't yearn for someone who doesn't know your existence or an acquaintance/friend who hasn't asked you out.",0.5,0.0,158.0,-0.3333333333333333,0.5,2450.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I’ve completely given up on dating and have decided to just get IVF,89,datingoverthirty,257,"Having a family and continuing my legacy is more important than (most likely) temporary happiness from a relationship. If you were a gambler would you bet on something with 50% odds or 100%? 

I’ve been single for years and men simply won’t commit or man-up. I’m tired, I’m broken and I’m over it. I’d rather just have my own kids via sperm donor and raise them how I like instead of waiting on a “Prince Charming” who doesn’t exist. 

Love is dead in 2020. Thankfully through science I won’t end up alone and will have someone who is all mine.

"For girls in label-less relationships, let's be grateful that we're getting the girlfriend experience minus the commitment from the guy.",0,dating_advice,84,"Instead of being bitter and resentful to the guy, why not think about it this way? You're on a date, and he paid for the food and drinks, and you have a companion. Enjoy him at the present moment. Have a clear perspective. 

If you're not in a commitment yet, don't work too hard for it if he doesn't want it (when you asked) . Have fun. Then just slowly fade away. Instead of blaming something else (be it your looks, the guy, or etc.), let's just be grateful and graceful that they treated us like a girlfriend minus the commitment. Say thank you for the fun then say goodbye. 

I know they say, communication is key, but this is for the relationships who already had the DTR talk and both parties know what they get out of it. 

As much as I hate to be biased and stereotype people, categorize these guys in your head. Don't lump them all in one category. 

There's plenty of young men who also take their life seriously. Mourn the loss, but move on completely. There are a million reasons why he won't commit. Focus on your self growth, and I know you will blossom.

Spoilers for Avengers:Endgame,0,MarvelStudiosSpoilers,309,"Hi guys, I work in Marvel Studios and I'm a member of the VFX team for Avengers Endgame. I have watched some parts in the second and first act of the movie and I also know the entire plot. Spoilers below.

&#x200B;

Act 1

* Emergency Broadcast saying  “THIS IS NOT A TEST. THERE IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN EFFECT. PLEASE STAND BY FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS."" Marvel Logo plays with Sta Lee Cameos and turns to purple colour. Scene cuts to Clint's farm, he trains his daughter. Family vanishes infront of him. He rushes to the TV an emergency broadcast plays.
* Cut to Wakanda where everyone mourns. They decide to regroup and set for Avengers Facility.
* Tony sees a dream where he has a son and everyone turns to dust.
* Tony wakes up. A song is playing. Cut to a scene of  Tony and Nebula playing paper Football. They are bored, hopeless and starving. Tony records his message to Pepper.

* The next scene cuts to Avengers Facility.Pepper hears the message after wearing a silver Iron Man armor \[probably Mark 49\] whose helmet was beeping. This is the photo which shows Pepper wearing an armor, and everyone thought was Rescue\] She is relieved that Tony is still alive.

Avengers arrive and Pepper asks them about Tony, Avengers think he is dead. She gives them Fury's pager\[which was recovered by police\] and watches the news as the Death toll rises.Captain Marvel's arrival scene. She is looking for Fury and they tell her Fury is dead. Thor blames himself for the snap.

* Scene cuts to Tony and Nebula, who repair the Benatar. They enter a jumpoint and as they move towards Earth the Sunlight flashes towards Tony's eyes.
* Pepper recieves the message.
* Captain America shaves. \[the scene from the trailer where he is wearing a vest.\] Black widow calls him to check what's happening outside. They watch the Benatar arrive.

Avengers don't believe him. His gauntlet is damaged. captain Marvel is very confident about killing Thanos. Thanos doesn't use the gauntlet and gains the upper hand against the Avengers. Black Widow and Cap mostly do planning and distract Thanos so that the stronger heroes can Damage him. Rocket and War Machine use a weapon to stun Thanos. After that, Cap Marvel badly damage him and Thor cuts off his arm. Thanos is beaten to pulp. Rocket goes mad at him for killing the guardians and starts to torture him with an extremely powerful electric weapon.

He is able to paralyze every Avenger using the stones except Captain Marvel who is strong enough to break the force and charge against him.

* Cut to a scene of Thor waking up in a wierd place. He has glowing yellow eyes. He sees his forefathers in a dining hall. They have white glowing eyes and look at Thor with disappointment. A mysterious figure welcomes him. The person appears to be Hela and she explains to him that the Gods who die are destined to live forever in Hel.

* Thor then turns and sees Loki who is paralyzed and  suffering endlessly for his actions, so is Odin.
* Thor tells Hela if there is anyway he can be reborn again. Hela tells her to escape Hel and go back to reality, he needs to kill the current ruler of Hel, which none of the Gods could complete. Thor makes a deal with her that he will kill the ruler of Hel so that Hela can become the new ruler in exchange for her army.

The face reveals to be Supergiant, and she is played by Katherine Langford.Thanos prepares to attack the Earth with a huge army of Outriders.
* In the meantime Avengers regroup in Wakanda.. They know only Hulk and Thor can wield the Gauntlet without dying, but Thor is already Dead. The gauntlet still needs to be developed. They know Thanos will attack and they go to Wakanda to ask help from the army. Rocket and Nebula use the Benatar to go to  Xandar. Nova prime is dead and they convince Rhomann Dey to avenge Xandar by providing them army to fight Thanos. Rhomann Dey, who is the new Nova prime mentions the names of some decimated comrades, which includes the names Ryder and Alexander. The Nova Corps agree to help.
* Thanos attacks Wakanda again, this time Supergiant leads the Outriders. Wakanda has a reduced army and the Avengers are losing the battle. M'Baku and okoye lead the Wakandan army. Supergiant is overpowered as hell. Tony works on completing the Gauntlet in Shuri's lab while the Avengers hold off Thanos and Supergiant. Cap is protecting Tony in the lab, similar to how Shuri was protecting Vision. The other Iron Man armors also fight the battle, along with a new black Hulkbuster controlled by rhodey.
* Scene cuts to Thor who fights the Midgard Serpent. He is damaged badly, but at the last moment Lightning starts to flow out of his veins and he becomes overpowered. He manages to defeat the Midgard Serpent and is rewarded with a belt which will help him to become stronger after taking damage and Hela's undead army. Hela becomes the new ruler of Hel. Thor turns to Loki and says he will come back for him.
* The Avengers are losing the fight but Rocket and Nova Corps join them. The Gauntlet is completed and Prof Hulk wields it while the rest of the Avengers hold back Thanos. Prof Hulk loses his arms and Cap wields the Gauntlet to bring everyone back but dies. Tony tried to stop him though. The dead heroes reappear exactly where they dusted. Strange creates a portal and the dead Titan heroes enter wakanda through the portal. All the Avengers team up together against Thanos and his army and Iron Man leads them. iron Man even says ""Avengers Assemble' and they all charge against Thanos to avenge Cap. Thanos is enraged and fights with the intent to kill. A ghost-like undead Thor appears with Hela's undead army, along with the Giant Wolf. Thor is overpowered \[even stronger than Captain Marvel\] and fights Thanos one on one. Strange fights Supergiant and kills her. Thor kills Thanos. War Machine, Okoye, M'Baku, Star-Lord and Black Panther die in the battle.
* Right after the battle a beam of light reaches the sky from the Quantum Tunnel and creates a huge Blackhole. This wasone result of altering the timeline. The Black Hole causes a lot of destruction and different realities start to collide. To save everyone, Iron-Man enters the Quantum Tunnel and destroys Quantum Realm's core using the Gauntlet's power killing himself and destroying the stones and the Quantum Realm in the process. Before that, he sees multiple futures where he leads a happy life with Pepper and children, and Peter parker is forced to close the Quantum tunnel with Stark inside it. The Black Hole then closes.
* Thor then travels to new Asgard \[which was built in Nidavellir\] and tells Valkyrie his time is past and she has to take care of ASgard. He takes Loki's place in Hel, bringing Loki back to life in his place, and Loki becomes King of Asgard and honors Thor by building a statue of him infront of Asgard.
* Hawkeye retires to family life

* Stark leaves a new suit and tech at Harley Keener's home and he will probably become IronHeart in future movies.
* Spider-Man and Strange quits Avengers.
* Winter Soldier and Falcon join Shield on a secret mission. Apparently, timeline alterations have restored Crossbones and Fury recruits them to fight him on a mission.

"PSA: Don't trust the reviews, Overwatch runs perfectly fine on the Switch.",0,NintendoSwitch,170,"I'm seeing a lot of reviews about the Overwatch port complaining it is literally unplayable and suffers from serious performance issues. This is simply not true. It's only true if your barometer for success is comparing it to Xbox/PS4/PC versions which is just unfair and pointless. I've logged hundreds of hours on Xbox/PC. Yes, the framerate isn't as good. Aesthetically speaking, it's not as crisp. But ""unplayable"" is such a ridiculous exaggeration. I've already logged close to 50+ hours on the Switch and have been loving it (not to mention, absolutely dominating every match). Zero problems with connectivity or lag.

This port wasn't made for people who obsess over frame rates and graphics. It was made for people who have never had access to Overwatch and provides a different avenue to introduce the game to a new generation. All these reviews claiming it's not worth playing are so god damn cynical and I'm really tired of reading them. TLDR: if you have a Switch and never played Overwatch, I highly recommend ignoring the reviews and enjoying it for what it is.",0.49,0.0,74.0,0.4166666666666667,0.5,1075.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Getting killed by police is a leading cause of death for young black men in America,0,Sino,35,"Just another example of the hidden, systematic racism and discrimination targeted against African-American minorities in the United States.

https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-08-15/police-shootings-are-a-leading-cause-of-death-for-black-men

About 1 in 1,000 black men and boys in America can expect to die at the hands of police, according to a new analysis of deaths involving law enforcement officers. That makes them 2.5 times more likely than white men and boys to die during an encounter with cops.

The analysis also showed that Latino men and boys, black women and girls and Native American men, women and children are also killed by police at higher rates than their white peers. But the vulnerability of black males was particularly striking.

“That 1-in-1,000 number struck us as quite high,” said study leader Frank Edwards, a sociologist at Rutgers University. **“That’s better odds of being killed by police than you have of winning a lot of scratch-off lottery games.”**

For instance, black women were about 1.4 times as likely to be killed by police as white women, the researchers found. Native American women were from 1.1 to 2.1 times as likely to be killed as their white peers.

The early 20s are a particularly dangerous time for young men, the researchers found. During the study period, police use of force accounted for 1.6% of all deaths of black men between the ages of 20 and 24. It was also responsible for 1.2% of deaths of Latino and Native American men. However, police violence accounted for just 0.5% of deaths of white and Asian American men in that age range.

Justin Feldman, a social epidemiologist at the New York University School of Medicine, said the most striking result for him was the mortality risk for black men and boys, which he called “pretty staggering.”

“That’s quite meaningful,” said Feldman, who was not involved in the study. “If it’s not you being killed by police, it’s someone you know or someone in your community.”

**“The United States is unique among wealthy democracies in terms of the number of people that are killed by its police forces,”** Feldman said. “I think the No. 1 thing it comes down to is a lack of accountability by police departments, both legally and politically.”",0.49,0.0,83.0,-0.08888888888888889,0.2777777777777778,2256.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Is it cheating to do continuous fire with non-automatic weapons (such as pistols) by holding on the fire button?,0,truegaming,62,"Some FPS allow you to continuously fire even with weapons that aren't machine guns and automatic in fire rate such as pistols and M1 Garand Rifle. For example in Return to Castle Wolfenstein I cannot tell you how I can quickly take out groups of Nazi soldiers clustered together with a Luger because I had my finger on the left mouse button and all I had to concentrate on was was moving the aim crosshair before the next round was shot. Because I didn't have to multi task by repeatedly pressing a button than aiming towards the next Nazi's head (which honestly takes away a few seconds per kill and is a big deal if you're in a firefight with a large group of enemies).

I am curious is this considered cheating in speedruns and multiplayer? Especially at professional E-Sports level such as Quakecon?

What are the disadvantages of treating non-automatic weapons such as a shotgun by using automatic gun fire controls by holding the fire button down as you keep on shooting rounds (like you would with a M16 or Chain gun)?

I know many mainstream games such as Call of Duty and Halo distinguish the difference and prevents you from doing this with shotguns, etc. But I am curious how this is frowned upon in competitive gaming and the cons of using this style of gameplay?",0.5,0.0,112.0,0.0,0.5,1275.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"So I saw a harmless CMDR in an Anaconda last night, so naturally I HAD to interdict!",0,EliteDangerous,235,"I was flying a fully engineered chieftain at the time and I just couldn’t resist.

I won the interdiction without to much trouble and we dropped. I immediately said “Boo” followed by an “o7”. I’m not one to attack CMDRs for no reason, we all play the game our own way. But what happened next really amused me! 

The CMDR turns back towards me at around 7km out and deploys their hardpoints. I put “Don’t do something silly!” into the chat but I think it only served to rile this CMDR up as they increased speed and began flying directly for me. Once in range they began to attack!

I don’t have crimes on most of the time so they did not incur a bounty, but they did incur my wrath! I quickly took their shields and brought them to 20% before they low waked. Yes you read that right, LOW WAKED!

I jumped into super cruise, interdicted them again, and took them to 5% before letting them go, I messaged “I hope you learned a lesson!”

That lesson? Know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em. Also know that if you are harmless in an unengineered ship you will likely have trouble with a CMDR who is neither of those things.

Later on I got a message from the **Anaconda who struck first** saying “It’s no wonder people prefer solo with no-lifer griefers like you in open”. I literally laughed out loud, between laughs I tried to explain in a civil manner that I meant them no harm and it was all in good fun. That they shouldn’t attack people and be upset they lost. That no griefer would let them live after that kind of affront. 

They told me to eat their ass but I had already had to much salt, see I prefer low sodium soy sauce so this was already to much. Boy it sure was funny though.

Edit: To many whiney players to answer all of you. If you think this most benign act of interdicting and waving is such a heinous offense you just shouldn’t play this game, not in open/solo/pg, not at all. And I say that with all sincerity. This is so basic an interaction where I initiated zero actually use of force after interdiction and completely let the CMDR run as I “o7”. If your fragile egos and sense of self cannot handle that I suggest you avoid online gaming all together. It is sad that people actually think THIS is such a big deal. Me, the big bad wolf for interdicting a player in open! I acknowledge making the first move but it was followed by zero hostility and a wave. God you are embarrassments to what I consider a great community. 

Edit: To the Care Bears who cry “griefer”, when you call this griefing no one will take anything else you say seriously. You are the boy who cried wolf.

Edit: Someone has since made a post inferring the lesson was lower combat ranked CMDRs shouldn’t be allowed to
Fly the big 3. I 100% do not think that. I interdicted the harmless anaconda because they are sorta of like Unicorns. You have to play a completely different way to get there with such a low combat ranking and I do respect that. Players should fly whatever ship they like.

PSA: NOTHING changed with the chem launcher self heal and you can still have your precious +30 extended mag,41,thedivision,233,"**DOUBLE TAP L1/R1 TO USE SELF HEAL ON CHEM LAUNCHER.**
Literally no difference in time to deploy if that's the only reason you were using the chem launcher.  

The +/- weapon mods we are used to are **STILL IN THE GAME**,  The current change to the extended mag everyone is crying about is because they added a whole new tier of pure +stat-only weapon mods.  So now you have a CHOICE whether you want a moderate stat boost for FREE, or trade stats like we have been doing.  Yes, you probably have to go grind it again in WT5 probably, but is that your only beef?  All of this was confirmed in the last SOTG.  

And lets be honest here, a 60 bullet mag on an AR was borderline comical.  At that point it encroaches on LMG territory. I use the same mag and I'll probably keep +10 bullets and 10% ROF, especially if youre running Sharpshooter with +30 reload speed, it's nothing.  

So for GODS SAKE stop crying and be grateful for devs that actually give a damn and communicate regularly for a live service looter shooter game not gated behind microtransactions (WHATTTTT).  If not, I'm sure the anthem community will welcome you.  

EDIT:  some are clearly still skeptical about the mags so here is a link to the latest SOTG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_6wwUw74fI&t=1154s
Timestamped at 19:15 its stated *""when there's multiple extended mags, then you're gonna see one that's extra bullets and no negatives, and then one that's MORE extra bullets and some negatives so then you have that choice""*

However, this is a terrible comparison because neither fire emblem or yoshi are made by Nintendo. They are made by much smaller studios who are also much less competent.

I don't know where to fit in anymore in this Country,2,metacanada,75,"I don't know what to do. I consider myself a good person, I respect others no matter what race/religion/gender they are, unless they are a shitty person. That's how it should be right?

I went back to school this year (finished uni 4 years ago, 27 years old now) for drug addiction treatment because I want to help others. I have been driven to this type of career path due to family history involving substance abuse and would like to help others that deal with the same.

But I honestly do not think I can do this in Canada anymore. I am in my last semester, and in order to graduate, I must take a gender studies course where white men are literally cast as evil people. I honestly thought the absurdity taught in these courses were satire at best, and rare occurrences at worst.

I skipped my test today because I refuse to write that white racism doesn't exist. This is being taught as fact.... that when it happens to a white person, it's not racist. The ""colour of skin+ institutionalized power"" meme is actually real...

&#x200B;

I feel I am being driven away and weeded out of this career field based on my colour, gender and opinions.

&#x200B;

A white girl literally told another classmate of mine that his opinion is not as valid because he is a white male.

In the same class, we were talking about ""toxic masculinity, and why men don't want to express their feelings in therapy""

In the same fucking lecture, at least 8 women in my class told stories, laughing about how they thought that their ex-boyfriends, male friends, or whatever that ""opened up"" to them (crying, expressing feelings) were a bunch of pussies and to man up and deal with it. **HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?**

How are the same people speaking about equality and fairness able to say this kind of shit in literally the same breath?

&#x200B;

Honestly, the people I have tried to talk to about this (""friends"" at school) think I am wrong, ""reverse racism"" doesn't exist,   and that I should just keep my head down and write the correct answers, pass and move on. Trust me, I want to. I want to get this goddamn shit over with so I can do real work, but I cannot honestly bring myself to write this stuff, even in false agreement. I will not be ashamed of who I am.

&#x200B;

The worst part is I can't argue this stuff, because it is clear that every ""white male response"" has been thought of and has had a ""fail-safe"" response implemented to discredit me:

* If I get angry, it's my toxic and/or fragile masculinity
* I just need to ""understand"" because I am a white male and have been privileged to be where I am
   * Side note: if my white privilege existed, I wouldn't be stuck in a room full of batshit self-hating white women. I'd be in space or something.
* If I am unsuccessful, it is because I am lazy/stupid
   * If I am successful, it's due to my skin colour
* If I and my white friends jump a black person, we are racist nazi's
   * If I am jumped by a group of black people that state this attack is due to me being white, apparently, this is just simple ""discrimination."" Racism does not apply in this case
* The girls can insult their boyfriends for expressing their feelings, but I am a misogynist if I said women's feelings don't matter
* They can also boast to each other about their frequent cheating of boyfriends openly, while simultaneously talking about how her boyfriend is about to buy her a car.

But does ""toxic femininity"" exist? Nope. This behaviour is only okay when it's done by anyone but white men that aren't sucking a cock.

&#x200B;

I am fairly good at keeping my head down and treading through the bullshit, but I am going to snap (my white fragility is leaking I guess)

&#x200B;

Seriously, what is the world coming to? Do these people not see the **blatant** hypocrisy? The issues that men have today are because of the shitty attitudes of the women that surround them. Those same women then ask each other: ""Why are men so oppressive?""

I am literally going to fail school because of this. I am going to have to go back to my ""toxic masculine white fragile"" construction work (because my  assigned gender roles made me choose this job too apparently)

&#x200B;

I'm sure that I'll get down-voted to oblivion for this, but maybe a few of those folks will read this post and gain a little perspective on the landlord's side of the rental market.

&#x200B;

I bought three buildings last year. A duplex that I owner-occupy and two fourplexes a couple doors apart in another part of town. I started my ""small business"" with almost exactly $140k in cash.

&#x200B;

The duplex came with an existing tenant who had no lease, had paid no security deposit, and was paying her rent weekly (and it seems only occasionally at that). I sat down with her and worked out a plan to get her on a lease and transitioned to paying her rent monthly. Still, I rent to her at well under market rent because she's lived there a very long time and wouldn't be able to afford  the full rent. The lower unit took me over two months of hard work to renovate to be nice enough to move myself and my children into. There was literally tar running down the walls from all the smoking. I had to scrub the ceilings, walls, and floors over and over and over again before I could even begin to paint. Most of the flooring had to be replaced. The cabinets had to be disassembled and scrubbed. I worked really hard to make it a nice place to live. I pay myself $850/mo in rent to live there.

&#x200B;

The fourplexes were very ""shop worn"" when I bought them. I've had two vacancies and completely renovated both apartments. I've replaced the roof on the garage of one of the buildings (\~$15k) and on one of the main buildings (\~$25k). I've done countless other repairs and improvements. While the roof was being replaced, a big storm came through and the ceiling collapsed in one of the upper units flooding it, the apartment below, and my laundry room. All of the legal advice I got was that the tenants were on their own and that their renter's insurance would cover places for them to live while repairs are underway. My tenants don't have renters insurance and can't afford things like hotels or short-term leases, so I paid to put one tenant up in an extended stay hotel (I wanted them to have a full kitchen) and I argued with the insurance company and got them to compensate the other tenant. In the meantime, both of their units will get full renovations and because of the 'commercial insurance,' I will only get the depreciated value of the fixtures and flooring (and they're old so I'm basically just going to have to pay for new cabinets, flooring, lighting, etc.). I charge less rent than the guy that owns the building in between mine. I looked at his vacant unit because I was going to rent it to re-home one of my tenants while my building was worked on but I can't ask anyone to live there. I'd consider it borderline uninhabitable. It explains why I have tenants calling every month or two asking if I have a vacancy for their friend/coworker/relative.

&#x200B;

So it's been about 1.5 years since I bought the first of the properties. I've put \~$140k into the venture and I've never taken a dime out of it. Everything I collect in rent goes toward paying the mortgages, doing maintenance and repairs, or making incremental improvements to bring the properties up to my standards. Yes, some of that $140k is the down payments on the buildings (\~$115k of it) and some of the monthly mortgage payment is paying down my loans (\~$750/mo) but I have a lot of money parked in this venture that could just as easily be making money in the stock market or earning interest in the bank. Now I'm burning through my reserves because of the roof collapse and may have to contribute more of my personal money to the business to make ends meet to get through this.

&#x200B;

And it's the 10th and so far I've collected four out of the ten rents (and one of them is the rent I pay myself!). That's six tenants that haven't paid rent this month. 

&#x200B;

One (the tenant in the duplex) sent me a note last night saying that she can't afford rent anymore and is moving out in a couple weeks. Frustrating, since she very recently signed a new lease...

&#x200B;

One is an inherited tenant that is month-to-month and has always been very late. I've worked so hard to get that tenant on-track but it's always excuses and outright lies. I'll be terminating their tenancy shortly. I can see how from some perspectives that makes me look like Scrooge McDuck, but nothing else is getting the point across.

&#x200B;

Another is a relatively new tenant that moved in, then quit/lost the two jobs they had to qualify for the apartment. I helped her get in touch with aid organizations and get back on track, but she paid her rent on time for a couple of months and then started telling with the late rents and excuses again. Last month she finally paid on the 30th. I've been as clear as I can be that I will work with her if she makes a reasonable effort and sticks with the plan, but she's combative and falling farther and farther behind. I'm sending the seven day notice today and I'll be surprised if I don't end up having to evict her. Again, I come out as Ebenezer in this but everyone ignores the months I've spent trying to help her make it work.

&#x200B;

In the end, this will all work out for me and I'll make some money. But it's not the free money these kids seem to think it is. Stuff breaks and buildings need constant upkeep. Some people treat other people's property very badly, sometimes maliciously. Disasters happen and I'm responsible.

&#x200B;

In the meantime, I'm sticking to the principles I laid out when I decided to start this venture. I want to provide people with as nice a place to live as I can, I reply to maintenance and repair concerns immediately, and I won't rent out an apartment that I wouldn't move into with my family. 

&#x200B;

I'll be locking up \~$150k for around five years before I can even think about pulling any money out of this and I'll be putting a lot of really long days doing really hard work in in the meantime. In another five years or so I should be taking some profits out. Hopefully, in 30 years or so I can cash out and have a nice bump in my retirement preparations.

A mindset to stay stress free in a LTR,8,FemaleDatingStrategy,52," Even if we are in a serious relationship and planning to start a family, there are still some hoops we need to jump through. This isn't some complicated strategic plan. It's a mindset EVERY working mother should have. Just a few pointers. In short: ***he should never be helping you.***

 He isn't 'helping' you when he does the dishes or laundry, he is doing his fair share because he also benefits from those chores, so he has to contribute.

He's not 'helping' you clean your home, because he also lives in it, and benefits from it being tidy.

 He isn't babysitting your kids when he's with them, he is raising them like he should be doing, because those kids are both of yours', and he needs to be a father in the proper sense of the word.

 It isn't an award-winning deed for him to be cooking, because you all need to eat.

 We as women deserve to NEVER feel guilty about letting other people pull their weight.

"Please, swallow your pride and revert some changes.",2,underlords,41,"I played autochess and  underlods after with a decent rank in both games, Queen and Spire so I guess I understand the basics of the games, despite I was a real casual gamer. 

I always tried to invite friends to play, the reasoning was that it was easy to learn and really casual. Still it offered the good amount of skill in the game if you wanted to become good.

The latest patch have some good Ideas, Duo is supergood I enjoy playing it with friends, Prison is a Decent idea, to change the meta. But the Underlords ruins the game, they add nothing except a pre-game choice. They make the game less casual when you are force to play to unlock skills, they are superhard to explain why and what skill you should pick up, and if/when you learn it, they still add nothing to the game. I must also say the UI is SHIT, the old one was clean and easy to explain, now everything is just smalll and NOT clean.

I've notice without thinking about it I've stopped playing the game, I've also stopped recommend it to friends. If valve want this game to grew they have to start with admitting their misstakes and revert bad changes.",0.5,0.0,51.0,0.0,0.0,1123.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Stealth dating isn't easy, even when it is",23,asktransgender,26,"I just wanted to share a recent stealth dating story (and breakup) for whatever educational value it has. It proves to me again how much the world very much hates us.

I live stealth and date that way. I pretty much only date cis guys. I've tried disclosing up-front, in the middle, and long-term all with crash and burn results.

Anyway, I recently met this great guy. He was tall, handsome, very intelligent, and I was able to hold a real conversation with him. He was extremely chivalrous, opening car doors, always paying for dinner, making reservations, etc. I only intended to go out with him for 1 or 2 dates, because, well.. stealth.

We dated for a month, talked every day via chat and phone, and got together several times per week. So this was a real relationship and it was developing fast. We were intimate on many occasions, although nothing overtly bad (never went all the way for obvious reasons and always remained respectable). It was going great. A total classic bf/gf situation, and it felt absolutely wonderful.

It got to the point (physically) where we kinda had to discuss something. After dating this guy for a month, I was hoping I knew him fairly well, and considering we were both intelligent upstanding adults with open minds, I was really hoping for the best. So, I made the stupid mistake of disclosing to him - in a very round-about way. He acts like it's no big deal. I'm shocked and absolutely on top of the world! Omg, this could actually be a real relationship like I read all the time from all these girls on reddit! Maybe these guys really do exist! lol

Later that day he goes quiet in text. Yes, I know this pattern. I already know what's going to happen. He texts me the next day that he wants to discuss something. I'm thinking its something totally different, because he seemed to be so understanding and a kind person. Turns out, he's dumping me saying that he can't be with ""someone like me"". He has his ""sexual preferences"". Wtf?

Now, you know this isn't about having a vagina or not, because we never ever went that far, and everything was going perfect. This is about transphobia plain and simple.

What a mistake. I should have just dumped him instead. But, I was in a fantasy world where trans women can actually be treated like human beings.

Hotfix - Gem Rocks & Uncut Onyxes,3,runescape,357,"Hello everyone,

Today, we released a hotfix to remove the ability to mine Uncut Onyxes from Gem Rocks. The reason for this that the amount of Onyxes in-game has increased by almost double since the Mining and Smithing rework and that it was an unsustainable amount of Onyxes being produced from Mining.

The amount of Onyxes being mined from Gem Rocks meant that over 10,000% more Uncut Onyxes were entering the game from Mining than before the update. This has completely saturated the game with Uncut Onyxes and meant that the gem has hit its alch price.

This hotfix allows us to try and salvage the Uncut Onyx market, it is a very valuable commodity in the RuneScape economy and had a healthy market prior to this problem. It will take time to recover but we hope that this hotfix today will allow it to start recovering.

We realise that this may be seen as a nerf to profitibility of skillers and want to reassure that this simply isn't the case. We want skilling to be profitable and will continue to release content in the future that help promote this.

Thanks,

The RuneScape Team",0.5,0.0,33.0,-0.5,0.8,1091.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Freaked out of find hollow floor in a hidden cave. Burial? Serial killer?,0,Bushcraft,57,"Was returning from a hike, trying to get out of the woods before dark.  I found a small cave, started to check it out, and discovered a hollow floor.  I was unprepared for something like that, and freaked out.  I did manage to record some video  (see link).  Thinking back on it, the size and shape of the cave makes me think human burial.  I feel a responsibility to return in case it is a missing person or murder victim.  I guess it could be a hunter's or survivalist's cache of food or equipment.  It could be nothing.  So I guess I'm going back to check it out.  If I don't get killed, I'll record more video and post it here.  Pray for me.  [https://youtu.be/eTaw1MHq3f8](https://youtu.be/eTaw1MHq3f8)

LeBron's defense is underrated,2,lakers,59,"2016’s postseason was the best defensive run by a wing ever. (You could argue 2012 too after Bosh went down and LeBron had to play a full time PF/C against West/Hibbert and Bass/Garnett while somehow also defending George and Pierce at the same time, but we didn't have the Tracking stats back then).

**Opponents' shooting against LeBron in Games 5, 6, and 7 in the Finals** 

Overall: 2.7/12.7, 21.1%, opponents usually shoot 47.9%, -26.8

Threes: .7/5, 13.3%, opponents usually shoot 40.4%; -27%

Twos: 2/7.7, 26.1%, opponents usually shoot 53.3%, -27.2%

Less than 6 ft: 1/5, 20%, opponents usually shoot 62.4%, -42.4%

Less than 10 ft: 1.3/6, 22.2%, opponents usually shoot 57.3%; -35.1%

Greater than 15 ft: 1/6.3, 15.8%; opponents usually shoot 40.5%; -24.7%

**LeBron 2016 Playoffs (21 games)**

3.2/10.2 Defensive FGs defended

Overall, held opponents to 31.8% FG (Their average FG% was 45.9%

This is a differential of -14.1% (He held opponents to -14.8% their average FG%), which is by far the best mark... For comparison, Draymond was next best at -8.4%

To break it down even further to perimeter defense and Rim protection..

**3PT DEFENSE**

LeBron was the Cavs best 3pt defender, and along with Livingtson and context taken into account, the best 3pt defenders

0.9/3.8 Defensive Field Goals Defended

Held opponent 3pt shooters to 24.1% (Their average 3PT% was 36.7%)

This is a differential of -12.6%

Only one guy who played 15+ playoff games (Shawn Livingston) had a slightly better differential (Abet on lower volume)

**RIM PROTECTION**

1.4/3.3 Defensive Field Goals Defended

Held opponents at the rim to 43.5% 

The best rim protection % on the Cavs

For reference Bogut held opponents to 46.6%, and Tristan Thompson 49.2%

**Here's also some stuff comparing him and DPOY winner Kawhi Leonard in the regular season;**

The usual field goal percent of the shooter that the player is defending
LeBron - 44.8%
Kawhi - 44.9%

**Defense Dashboard**

2pt FGs - Players shot 8.2% worse than their average when defended by LeBron

2pt FGs - Players shot 7.3% worse than their average when defended by Kawhi

When they were the closest isolation defender

LeBron - 69 possessions, .59 points per possession allowed, 28.8% eFG

Kawhi - 61 possessions, .69 points per possession allowed, 31% eFG

Kawhi - 96 possessions, 1.05 ppp, 51.2 eFG

**Finals Averages**

2.3 Blocks a game

2.6 Steals a game

**2016 Playoff Averages**

2.3 Steals a game

1.3 Blocks a game

In the last 3 games, LeBron averaged 3 blocks and 3 steals per game

It was also the second highest DBPM chamionship run behind only '04 Ben Wallace.

Edit: Bring the downvotes doesn't change the facts. He was robbed of DPOY in 2009 and 2013. LeBron is still one of the best defenders in the league. ",0.51,0.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,3817.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

This community's response to Cube World fills with with the desire to Go To Sleep,61,CubeWorld,197,"Hi, I'm a game developer from a small studio. I have a few things I'd like to say, since a lot of folks have been having questions and making takes that I disagree with. A lot of these show a lack of understanding for how game design works. There are a few common questions that I've seen voiced, which I can answer.

1. ""Why doesn't Wollay add skill trees? It'd be an easy change, and we want it!""

Given the limited scope of Cube World's skill system, it didn't make sense for the game to ever have skill trees in the first place. Skill Trees are useful in circumstances where you want to offer players choices in buildcraft. Cube World's buildcraft comes first from your class, and second from your subclass; while both classes and subclasses provide new mechanics for a player to use, the skill trees only add numbers. You really want player choice to be about the mechanics they have, since mechanics are how the player is going to interact with your game. The numbers your skills have will continue to increase regardless. Adding skill trees would do nothing to the game's core design.

2. ""Why are my items useless after I leave a region? Region-locking's dumb!""

Every rpg with level progression has the equivalent of region-locking. If you log into WOW or Final Fantasy or a Dragon Quest game and play the game for 10 levels, you get all the best gear and do the content for those levels. Then you reset. You go to an area for level 11-20 players and the gear you just got is functionally equivalent to when you started. When you go to the new level 11-20 area, you're now level 1 in a level 1-10 area again, but the game's telling you you've made progression. The difference in most rpgs is that your progression is marked by the addition of new mechanics; a healer starting a game only with Heal and Ward spells might have a Resurrect or Empower Attacks spell by the time they've gone to the new area. Cube World's  a bit different, since it doesn't have very many mechanics to give you. A mage isn't going to learn new spells because a complicated combat system just isn't currently in the scope of the game.

3. ""But I want skill trees! And I don't want regionlocking!""

That doesn't make skill trees good design, and it doesn't make the way regions work bad design. What you're asking for is a different pretty paint over the exact same game systems in place currently. Would it really make ya feel better if the game showed other regions as level 11+ after you beat the first one? It'd be exactly the same as it is now.

4. ""The Alpha was so much better! Why does the beta suck?""

The Alpha was almost completely devoid of any content or objectives. The game didn't have anything to do. You could run around aimlessly killing things if you wanted and get shiny slightly higher-statted gear. That was it. Now it has a ton of variety, enemy types, and cool flavorful quests.

5. ""Can Wollay sell this game to a company who knows what they're doing? Give it to X Dev they'll fix it""

Fuck you. I wouldn't work on a game from a dev whose userbase treats them like they're disposable. It wouldn't be safe for me or anybody working on the project. Seriously, all you people getting riled up that your bucks didn't get you your nice perfect dream game aren't worth listening to. Specifically you are the people whose opinions we discount when we're considering feedback because your opinion is worthless.

6. ""Why are you being such a bitch? I just want the game to be good. Can't you be nicer""

Seeing people treat Wollay like dirt over the years has filled me with an indescribable fury. Start treating him like a fucking person, because the way you've talked about Wollay and Cube World will be the reason it's never the game you want it to be.",0.54,0.0,81.0,0.0,0.0,3755.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Why Artifact isn't a good game (played over 100 hours),355,Artifact,646,"Being competitively viable isn't enough, in fact, for most people its competitive viability isn't even something they consider.  I've played over 100 hours of it, yet I wouldn't say I've enjoyed playing Artifact, I just keep giving the game a chance because it's DOTA 2 related (I want to love it). So here's my personal impressions as to why Artifact is still bleeding players and why it will probably continue to do so.

**Matches are long, yet uneventful** 

There are no interesting individual moments in any of the matches. It's a string of bland (if difficult to make) decisions one after another. Once a game has ended, the only ""memorable"" thing is the result of the match, this is unlike not just DOTA 2, but unlike any good game. 

Argentine writer Julio Cortazar famously argued that a story is a boxing match between its readers and the author, and that short stories needed to win the fight by KO, while novels needed to win by points. The same concept can be applied to videogames. 

Games of Artifact are very long, so it needs to win over the player by ""hitting"" him consistently. It does not accomplish this. It tries to win by KO through the final exciting moments at the end of a game, but the games are just too long for that, the payoff would have to be extraordinary to counterbalance the previous tediousness, not to mention the KO moment isn't particularly great or memorable either.

**Cards don't do anything fun or even interesting**

The best way I've come up with to convey this idea is by asking people to imagine how an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh would be if they were playing Artifact instead:

>Yugi: I play shortsword. This item card gives any equipped hero +2 attack, by equipping it to Lich, I increase his attack to 7, enough to kill Drow Ranger. If we both pass, she will finally fall.  
>  
>Crowd: Come on, Yugi, you can do it!  
>  
>Kaiba: So predictable. I knew you'd try to kill my Drow Ranger using that cheap item from the very beginning... I play Traveler's cloak!   
>  
>Joey: Oh no.  
>  
>Tea: What?  
>  
>Joey: Traveler's cloak increases the HP of any equipped hero by 4, Yugi's Lich won't be able to kill his Drow Ranger if they both pass.  
>  
>Tea: I'm sure Yugi has something up his sleeve.  
>  
>(...)

Most of the effects are so uninspired they resemble filler cards from other games. 

**The combat system is flavorless and boring**

The game is built around piles of stats uneventfully hitting each other after each player passes, combat isn't 1/1,000,000 as satisfying as it is on Magic or HS. Units will attack pass each other, their combat targets are chosen somewhat randomly... 

Compared this to games where players control the entirety of ""fights"" one way or another. Players feel that the combat, the main element, is under their control and they've got to be strategic about what to target and what to protect.

In Artifact, the most important decisions are about how many stats to invest in each individual lane, not about the combat itself. This is inherently less fun. The combat in Artifact is so boring the screen starts moving to the next lane before the animations from the current battle are finished.

**You don't learn much by playing the game**

Artifact does a terrible job of explaining to players what's a good and what's a bad play. For example, too often the right play is to let your hero die, that's just bad game design. It's very confusing to players and a poor use of contextual information. 

Let me put that in perspective, why are we defending with plants in Plants vs Zombies? Is it just because it sounds fun, cute, or something like that? No, it's because plants don't move in the real world, so to the player it makes immediate sense why his or her defenses can't switch from one lane to another.

Compare this to Artifact's random mini-lane targeting mechanic. Why are our heroes standing next to each other, ignoring each other, and hitting each other's towers? This a textbook example of good game design vs poor game design. 

In general, Artifact doesn't provide clear and consistent feedback to the player about his actions, nor it leverages from its knowledge of everyday things to convey its rules and goals more effectively, therefore, players don't understand why they lose, why they win, and don't feel like they're improving, killing their interest in the game (maybe, they start thinking, it's all RNG).

**Heroes make the game far more repetitive**

Because heroes are essentially guaranteed draws and value, games are inherently more repetitive than in other card games, this is probably why Valve added so many RNG elements elsewhere and why there's no mulligan. 

To add insult to injury, there are very few viable heroes (despite launching with 48 different ones), making games extremely, extremely repetitive. Worse yet? Many goodheroes are expensive, so new players just find themselves losing to the same kind of things over and over and over again, and considering all that I've said, why would they want to pay for the more expensive viable heroes?

**Its randomness feels terrible**

By this I don't mean that they determine the outcome a match often, there's so much RNG per game of Artifact that almost all of it averages out during the course of a single game (there are some exceptions to this, like Multicast, Ravage, pre-nerf Cheating Death, Homefield Advantage, Lock...), this is particularly true of arrows.

However, that doesn't mean RNG in Artifact is well designed. Arrows and creep deployment feel absolutely awful to the player that didn't get his way, same with hero deployments. Whether they're balanced or not is of secondary importance, that only matters if players want to keep playing. 

**Conclusions (TL;DR)**

Artifact is boring and frustrating. The combat, card design and match length are killing the game. There are too many RNG variables that are balanced, yet frustrating to play around.

POLL: adding a PvE mode / removing PvP from Adventure,0,Seaofthieves,1,"_To clarify; and for full disclosure, I would **not** like to see any change to the game, and don’t want to see PvP removed._

Hi everyone,

I’ve seen a real spike in posts requesting a PvE only Adventure mode or for PvP to be removed entirely from Adventure.

I know there’s a constant steady stream of people asking this, but I really wanted to gauge the temperature of the sub on the whole.

So, I’ve compiled a survey, it’s one question, and it’s very simply just trying to gauge the feeling around segmenting the playerbase by adding another Adventure Mode, or removing PvP from adventure all together, and I’d be really grateful if you guys could take the 2/3 seconds to fill it out

[Go here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdELNbaKjzEnMyEy6ej58IRrNfhldJ7spXBkaW31hGmNiQnIw/formResponse)

I’ll probably run this for 48/72 hours and then feed back the results and maybe follow up with a further survey based on the results.

Thanks.",0.46,0.0,53.0,0.0,0.0,948.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

This is BS!",0,ProtonMail,331,"**UPDATE: So after posting this thread I have gotten more specific replies from ProtonMail.Apparently the account was shut down at the request of law enforcement. They have not yet confirmed if they had a court order or not. They also said the account has breached their Terms of Service.**

**I have asked several question (as have many others in here) some of them are:**

* *Did they get a court order from a Swiss court?*
* *How long is this valid for? 1 month, 3 months? 1 year?*
* *Did you do anything to fight this?*
* *Why haven't you sent a copy of the request? Or a notice?*
* *What is the criminal offense I'm suspected of? Is it also considered a ""crime"" in Switzerland?*
* *Can I appeal this decision? If yes, then why wasn't I told this beforehand?*
* *If  you have already bent over for law enforcement regarding this then what  else have you assisted them with? Login password? IP logs? Meta data?  Are email content protected by your zero-access encryption?*

**They have answered here in the thread about how to get the questions answered:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/dd5dkk/warning\_long\_time\_account\_disabled\_protonmail/f2exvk6?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/dd5dkk/warning_long_time_account_disabled_protonmail/f2exvk6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>*The way to get your questions answered is not through Reddit. It is by  providing us your contact details, so we can forward them to the  relevant authorities who can provide you with the information you seek  through official/legal channels.*

So that's what I will do. I will send them an email with contact information. **Because WE ALL NEED ANSWERS!**

I wish I didn't have to create this thread to get a somewhat straight answer from ProtonMail. But it is what it is.

This thread got a lot more hot then I thought it would. I have received support from many that agree with me and also want answers but there is also a lot of supporters for ProtonMail who doesn't really get it and have more of a ""*well he's doing dodgy shit so his account should be shut down*"" kind of attitude. This isn't about what my account was involved in or not. **This is a privacy issue that affects everyone using ProtonMail**. If this can happen to me it can happen to you as well. Dodgy shit or not.

**I also want to point out to people that what the account was used for since a lot of people are asking.** It was used as a customer support for a website (not dark web) that I work for that sells different chemicals. Completely legal in many countries and considered a grey area in others. Much like other products such as peptides for example.

**ORIGINAL POST:**

I'm so furious right now...I've lost access to my entire life and ProtonMail refuses to tell the truth, be transparent or even reasonable. ProtonMail **is NOT what it promotes it self as!** Be aware all!

OK so lets start from the beginning.I tried to login to my account as I do everyday and get the following message: ""*Account disabled for abuse or fraud. You can find more information and contact us here.*""I'm thinking, hmm this is strange this has never happened before. So I reload the website and try again. Same error.I contact ProtonMail using the form on the website. I have included the message below for you all to read.

They first replay and say it was **disabled due to spam**. This is absolute BS as I don't spam ever and I replay what I think might be the cause.

They then answer that now all of a sudden **my account has been reported for ""criminal activity""** and will remain disabled. What the hell? Have can they possible know that and what proof do they have of that? I didn't receive any warning or notice beforehand whatsoever! I asked them to enable the account but disable sending messages for 48 hours so I can get a chance to access some important emails contains hosting details, 2FA codes etc as this is very important. This is my business we're talking about here. I will lose money and much more if they won't even let me access the account to get some emails.

I have always spoken good about ProtonMail and recommended it to friends, business partners, etc. But I find this ridiculous. A service that promotes itself as a secure, private and transparent Swiss company is acting like this.If they want to disable accounts without telling the truth then fine. But at least give a notice or something. Don't just look customers out of their account and make BS excuses. Not even Gmail does that!

**My replay**

Hello,

Thank you for your replay.

Wait what?I haven't sent any spam whatsoever. The email is a support mail for my business. I simply replay emails only.

If  there is emails considered spam it must be because my website was using  SendGrid for sending out order confirmations from my website and as  sender I used \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*@protonmail.com so it would be simple for customers to replay.

It's been like that for over a year.I didn't know this was a problem.  Can you tell me what kind of spam this is?

Please, I really need to get access to the account as I have important messages there.

Please let me know asap.

Best regards,

Hi,Thank you for the message.We  have received reports that your account was used for criminal  activities. This is a direct and strong violation of our terms and  conditions, therefore your account will remain disabled.Best Regards, Deni

\----------------------------------------------------------------

**My replay**

Wow, that's ridiculous. What kind if criminal activity? Where is  the proof of that? This is not fair. Don't you need a court order or  something for that? Can you send the report to me please?

I  can understand if it will be disabled but at least unlock it for 48  hours or something and give me the chance to access my hosting  information and other important messages. I didn't get a warning or  anything.

My life is in there and I'm not asking for much, I just need  access to be able to change some things such as domains, logins to other  websites etc. I have for example 2FA codes sent to that email that I  need to be able to get to access bank accounts etc.

You can even disable  sending messages during this time. After that it can be permanently  disabled.Please get back to me. This is my life we are talking about here.

**My replay**

Yes and I accept that but what I can not accept or understand is  how the hell you can't let me access important damn emails? Are you  f\*\*\*\*ng serious!? My login information to crypto wallets etc is in that  email and you won't let me access it for even 24 hours?? That's  absolutely inhumane. Don't you understand that is   f\*\*\*\*ng my whole life up and that I will lose a lot of money and  domains if you won't enable my account temporarily!? Is this how you  treat your clients? Seriously, no warning, no notice, no nothing. And  the spam story is BS. You know it and I know it. I haven't spammed  anyone.

And whatever happened to your so called transparency?

I'm  not even asking you to fully ""enable"" the account. Just let me login  and be able to receive email. I don't have to be able to send anything.

Or at least do a forward or something?

I  will not accept this and will post this entire story and conversation  on public forums to warn others so this won't happen to them. Because  this is absolutely ridiculous and bizarre!

Get back to me ASAP!

This subreddit has been incredibly toxic and shitty towards the devs and their reaction is completely understandable,14,apexlegends,91,"Let's put this into perspective: the devs made an event for us to enjoy. Huge community backlash. Within a few days, devs decided to listen to community feedback and take action. They admitted they messed up and addressed our concerns. They expected players to be thankful that they listened to the feedback and acted appropriately.

Wrong. People continue to insult and berate the devs. Calling them ""money hungry fucks"" and ""clowns"" and ""EA's bitch."" Calling respawn a bunch of idiots for one reason or another. 

Well, respawn snapped. In a moment of weakness (Gamer Rage™), they let loose all the emotions they've been bottling up up for the past 6 months. All those times where they were berated and looked the other way, they finally said **fuck that. How dare the players berate us after we listen to their feedback.**

I mean imagine how infuriating that would be, to be berated after demonstrating that you're willing to listen to criticism and adjust accordingly. 

Now, I'm not justifying their actions or responses. They were unprofessional. But just think for a minute what it's like in their shoes: trying to please the community but facing personal attacks and insults. Dealing with people that act like asshats (yes, don't pretend there aren't asshats in this subreddit). 

The cosmetics store is not perfect. In fact, it is a work in progress. But respawn has shown that they are willing to listen to community feedback. It makes no sense to personally attack the devs over the store when they have just demonstrated that they are willing to listen to the players! Personal attacks should be substituted with civil criticisms. End of story. 

The devs are human, they make mistakes. That doesn't give you the excuse to be toxic. Toxicity just adds gasoline to the fire. That is not what this community needs.",0.52,0.0,116.0,0.5,0.65,1825.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Can we talk about sex vs. gender?,0,BabyBumps,86,"The conflation of sex and gender has really been frustrating me since becoming pregnant. I'm hoping that anyone who chooses to respond to this can understand that I don't mean what I'm writing as an attack on anyone's personal choices. I'm curious instead if anyone else shares my same concerns or frustrations, and if there's anything other than correcting everyone who asks me, ""Are you gonna find out the gender?"" that I can be doing address this frustration.

Sex is determined on a biological basis. When we see a lil' ween on the anatomy scan, our doctor is determining that the sex of our child is male. Or when our NIPT results come back having found only X chromosomes, that means our child's sex is female. 

Gender is identity based, and there's just no way for any of us to know definitively the individual gender of our unborn children. Further, gender is constructed over time and as such is fluid - a child who identifies as female at age 5 may not feel the same at 50, or 15. Yes, gender is shaped by social constructs and norms, and sex generally drives the gender we initially raise children as (i.e. if I have a child with a vagina, I will personally raise them as a girl, and use she/her pronouns initially). That said, gender is not the same as sex, and I feel like the two get mixed up and used interchangeably in the context of pregnancy.

I am REALLY excited to find out the sex of my baby. I can't wait. And while it's not my style, I totally get the many expectant parents who want to find out through a celebration where this very formative piece of information is revealed. I take no issue with ""gender reveals,"" other than the fact that they are ""sex reveals."" Since becoming pregnant, it feels even more important to me that folks call it what it is - doing otherwise reinforces the idea that sex and gender are the same thing, that gender is not fluid, and that there are not gender identities beyond the binary of male and female. It feels like it shuts down options for a child's gender expression to steep an unborn child's existence in a particular gender identity (again, gender, not sex) before they're even born.

I'm not critiquing parents who choose to have a sex reveal where everything is pink or blue, or parents who want to dress their female-sex children in girly dresses with ribbons every single day or drape their male newborns over a football and take pictures of them as the ""next biggest [team] fan."" (I mean, babies are basically adorable tiny human dolls and we gotta put them in all the absolute cutest clothes, male, female, or neutral, before they develop the ability to protest, right?) What bothers me is the mix up of language. Cut into a blue cake at a sex reveal party! Go HAM with the colored confetti in sex reveal balloons! But how can we get folks to call it what it is?

Does anyone else feel this way? Is there a productive and empathetic way to talk about this with each other and other pregnant folks in our lives?",0.48,0.0,33.0,0.0,0.0,2983.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The blatant and unapologetic misogyny of ep 804.,0,freefolk,151,"It's extremely disheartening how much the show has taken a nosedive. The show has abandoned everything it was about and it's heart to believe G.R.R.M has any ties to what's unfolding here. In particular, the misogynist undertones were utterly horrendous.

We have Brienne, a stellar female character in her own right, reduced to a helpless, sobbing heap, crying after her prince charming as he rides off into who-knows-where (yeah, that trope totally hasn't been done 18174 times before D&D...), and then we also have Sansa and Arya, who, against all common sense logic, are determined to play the role of catty sisters-in-law to its bitter end. It couldn't be more evident that a woman didn't have anything to do with writing the script the season. No other way to say this, but honestly who else but men enjoys pitting female characters against each other for the most inexplicable of reasons lol. 

They took Sansa (someone who as a rape survivor has endured more than Jon/Dany/Arya ever have), built her up to be an intelligent and hardened character who knows how to draw lessons from the hardships life threw at her, and then butcher her character into this petty little person that seemingly wants nothing more than to make harder the life of another fellow woman (the female lead, no less). Absolutely ghastly. 

Then they have Daenerys of course sitting through all the setbacks she's been dealt over the course of this episode - all of which were rushed and half-assed just so they can quickly establish their mad queen narrative within the next 2 episodes. Because you know, women can't think rationally enough to be leaders (as Varys was kind enough to point out, cocks are important), and even a strong lead like Dany who spent 7 seasons looking out for the most vulnerable and other fellow women isn't immune to the disease of irrationality that's exclusive to the double X-chromosome bearers. And after this 70 minutes of steaming misogynistic drivel, let's have ourselves an execution where we sprinkle in some gratuitous violence against women, because why not. And let's make the focus of Missandei's death be about Grey Worm's reaction, because naturally Missandei's primary value was in how much a man valued her.

I don't have the slightest doubt this comment will be downvoted by empathy-lacking basement dwellers, but I needed to vent this somewhere lol.

"My name is Deborah E Lipstadt, author of ANTISEMITISM HERE AND NOW. AMA.",375,IAmA,1273,"Hello Reddit!

I’m Deborah E. Lipstadt author of the new book ANTISEMITISM: Here and Now.

My new book focuses on the current incarnations of antisemitism on both the political right and left: from white supremacist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, to mainstream enablers of antisemitism such as Donald Trump and Jeremy Corbyn, to a gay pride march in Chicago that expelled a group of women for carrying a Star of David banner.

Ask me anything!

Overblown bfa hate,1,wow,150,"This is more ranting than anything else, but I’ve noticed that the community especially on the Reddit and forums is so immature. Bfa hate has gotten to a whole new completely overblown level, while there are some issues like the gcd changes that I disagree with, for the most part bfa isn’t differing much from any other wow expansion in the past or any other game for that matter. For example, the toys to pay for the esports rewards is a very common model for esports rewards from many different games. And my karma is gonna fucking die as a result of this exact immaturity I’m talking about of hating anything positive about retail wow. But in all honesty, I’m having fun in bfa, and I would strongly encourage people who are getting into wow to give it a shot and not listen to the overblown and overwhelming hate happening throughout the community. Call me a blizzard fangirl or a shill or whatever the hell, I’m kinda expecting to get shit on for this because it’s differing from what’s become so commonplace. But I’d be down to discuss any real issues with it if anyone wants to be mature about it. Thanks for giving me some decency if ya do <3",0.51,0.0,18.0,-0.8,0.9,1151.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Unpopular opinion: i like how difficult the betrayal encounters are,1,pathofexile,42,"I’ve seen a ton of posts get a lot of attention, saying anything from “stop making syndicate members run away” to “I get killed by the chaos dude a lot so nerf pls”  and I just wanted to say that it’s amazing to have hard content which forces you to think of your defenses.

For the past 5 leagues, the creeps has only become weaker compared to the player, and making a build is solely about how many more modifiers you can smack on one build (tombfist ie), so seeming that GGG forces you to build more defensively and actually invest in chaos res, makes me very happy. I’m happy that I can play strong builds and don’t have to plow through content with a windrioper and quant gear and also I’m happy that you actually have to work for it, instead of it being RNG gated! 


Thank you GGG for AMAZING league mechanics.
