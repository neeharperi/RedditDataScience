TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,161828,a99fw9,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a99fw9/tifu_by_buying_everyone_an_ancestrydna_kit_and/,9044,"Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,137935,ak2k64,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ak2k64/tifu_by_living_in_a_dark_bedroom_for_6_years/,2601,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",1548521709.0,moby323,True,False,False,0.95

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W

Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

Oh, and if you can read this, I’ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

The other day when I was round at hers and she asked what memes were popular at the moment so I told her about the ""OK boomer"" meme. She knew what boomers were already so she was able to get the concept of this meme fairly easily. 

Fast forward to today, I'm over at my gran's again, and she's on the phone to my aunt. They got into a disagreement over a slightly racist comment my aunt made the other day (my gran is very much against racism) and my gran eventually just said ""OK boomer"" and hung up.

I've never been so proud.

I’ve learned a lot from the Reddit community over the past year (check out this fascinating [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/adxzo7/what_areas_of_robotics_research_are_you_most/) on robotics research), and I can’t wait to answer your questions.

If you’re wondering what I’ve been up to (besides waiting in line for hamburgers), I recently [wrote](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) about what I learned at work last year.

Melinda and I also just [published](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) our 11th Annual Letter. We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.

One of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.

**Proof:** [https://](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)[reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant\_wait\_to\_kick\_off\_my\_seventh\_ama/](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)

**Edit:** I have to sign-off soon, but I’d love to answer a few more questions about energy innovation and climate change. If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I’ll answer as many as I can later on.

**Edit:** Although I would love to stay forever, I have to get going. Thank you, Reddit, for another great AMA:  [https://imgur.com/a/kXmRubr](https://imgur.com/a/kXmRubr)",1551116216.0,thisisbillgates,True,False,False,0.8

Dying Before April: My Endgame,108476,actrm0,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/actrm0/dying_before_april_my_endgame/,3949,"Liver cancer, mouth cancer, bone marrow failure. Will probably be dead before April. I've heard of people getting early screenings before. 

How do I get in on this action? 

I'm not a child or anyone with a particularly tragic story. Just a normal guy. I'm 33, lost my sister three years ago to the same rare genetic disease it turns out I have too. I'll leave behind a devoted girlfriend and an adopted greyhound.

I thought I'd make it to April at least but my bone marrow is toast.

Any suggestions?

**Edit:**

...

Wow.

Girlfriend brought me coffee in bed and I just read this entire thread. People offered me their organs. There's a hashtag on Twitter:

""Avengers4Alexander""

 This is crazy. 

God I hope I've never said anything dodgy in my comment history. 

Thank you all.

***

**Edit2:**

It's been a surreal day for me. There are articles on blogs and I heard someone talking about me in a YouTube video. 

I've had thousands of messages and comments of support and I'm very grateful. I've had lots of questions too and I've done my best to answer all of them. If I missed yours it's not personal, it's just that my inbox is out of control.

I've had background anxiety all day that I've said something offensive on reddit at some point and someone is gonna find it, but so far so good. That anxiety is of course drowned out by all the good feels.

I've had messages from people hinting that Marvel higher ups are aware of me and are preparing something. 

Also, because Australia is a small place, turns out I know a guy who knows a guy who is chums with Chris Hemsworth. I think they called him tonight on my behalf.

A mod on r/thanosdidnothingwrong asked for some proof so I sent something a little while ago. I think he'll disseminate it to other mods but if mods here want to see something let me know.

I don't know what the outcome will be but this has been amazing. If it doesn't pan out don't sweat it - I'll carry your kind words with me and that's worth far more.

If I do survive until Endgame it's gonna feel strange because I'll feel sorta obligated to die :-P

Lastly, I don't mean to be greedy but since I'm triple dying can we throw Captain Marvel into the mix?

**Edit3:**

I've had a few messages from people assuring me that Disney/Marvel are going to reach out. Thank you all for all of your support. I'm hoping I get to say ""we did it reddit!"" soon.

A few commenters have offered financial support. I've told them that money isn't my problem, just time. Instead I'd like to direct you to donate money for research into my genetic disease, Fanconi Anemia. You can do that [here](https://www.fanconi.org/donate).

***

**Edit4:**

#We did it Reddit!

Disney have reached out and we are discussing options. I cried when I read their email. It's everything I hoped for and I owe it to all of you.

***

**Edit5:**

I'm doing an AMA on Jan 24 at 7pm EST for those interested at r/IAmA

***

**Edit6:** 

I'm having SIRTEX treatment today. There's a 99.2% chance this will buy me more time, though Fanconi Anemia might affect this number dramatically.

If for some reason it doesn't work out, goodbye Reddit, and thank you.

**Edit7:**

I'm still alive. I've just come out of what feels like a weeks-long dream. I'm on fentanyl and morphine 24/7 now, and it took a while to get the dose right, e.g, find the happy medium between screaming and being unconscious.

I can't cough, sneeze, laugh or burp now without through-the-roof agony, but I'm finding ways to manage these bodily functions to make them less painful. Typing this right now, I'm in no pain at all, and I've been up and out of bed and moving around, so my quality of life is still good.

A recent scan I had (after my pain escalated suddenly) revealed a host of bad things going on, few of which I know anything about yet. Following each of these up is the next step of my journey.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your support.

**Edit8:**

So I have lung cancer now.

***

**Edit9:**

They were wrong - it's liver metastases, not lung cancer. They can't be 100% sure because the lesions are in a position they can't biopsy, but they seem confident of their revised diagnosis.

My liver cancer has mutated an immunity to the first-line chemo. There is no second-line funded by Medicare. Fortunately, my doctors were able to apply to the manufacturer for compassionate access to the second-line drug and were successful. I started this new, more hardcore chemo three days ago. 

I'm gonna make it.

***

**Edit10:**

Tomorrow is the big day. 

I was admitted to hospital last night. While I was unconscious, a doctor asked my girlfriend whether they should resuscitate me if my heart stopped. When she said 'yes', they told her she was cruel and that I'd been through enough already. 

Fuck that guy.

My biggest challenge tomorrow will be making it out of here. I'm going to a 4.45pm session. Remember, if you spoil any part of Endgame, for anyone, I will haunt you, and not in a nice Casper way.

I hope you all enjoy Endgame. With luck I'll be there too.

***

**Edit11:**

NO SPOILERS

I fucking made it.

http://imgur.com/gallery/gwK7OKS

It took some ""negotiating"" around the hospital bureaucracy to escape. We told them we were going to see a movie. They granted me a two hour pass before I'd be considered discharged against medical advice. We were gone for about eight :-D.

We had the best seats in the house. I had a bag full of morphine and vomit bags which fortunately I didn't have to use. I was so enraptured with what was happening onscreen that it wasn't until it was over that I realised quite how sick and sore I was.

After the movie we had missed calls from the hospital, but fortunately my room was still empty when I got back. The nurses were a tad cranky. Worth it.

I won't share anything about how much I enjoyed Endgame here - you'll find me participating in the discussion throughout this subreddit. There's so much to talk about, I don't think I'll get bored of it in my lifetime.

Thanks to my crew who held our place in line, got us the best seats, carried me to my walker and matched my enthusiasm for the movie. Thanks to my bb who has been carrying me through life for a long time now, especially in the past week, and especially last night. I couldn't have made it without her, not nearly.

Thanks to Disney for [redacted].

And thanks to you guys - I was buoyed by your support. Every message reminded me that I could make it here. There was a part of the movie that really captured how I felt when you all came out to bat for me - I think you'll know it when you see it.

See you all around!

**Edit 12:**

Alexander's gf here. After seeing Endgame, he was in and out of hospital and told there were no further treatment options that would do less harm than good. 

He came home to be with his mum, me and Creeky. He saw the rest of GoT with all our friends around us. He blew the airhorn as soon as Cleganebowl began. In the finale he'd predicted several plot endings.

We were by his side until he left us Sunday morning.

I love you 3000. I wish I was in the 1 timeline where you were still here <3
